# Install and setup notes

To work on this project locally you need to have a copy of Jekyll installed. [Start Here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) with the official documentation on how to install Jekyll on your platform.

Once you have setup Jekyll you can clone this repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and CD into the directory you've cloned into and execute the following command:

`bundler`

This will install all of the required gems and set up your system to run Jekyll. Then you can run:

`jekyll build`

To build the site. To serve the site locally run:

`jekyll serve --watch`

This will build the site, start the local webserver and watch the directory to automatically rebuild on any changes. Just point a browser at [Localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see your site.
