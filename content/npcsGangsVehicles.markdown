# NPCs, Gangs, and Vehicles

#### **NPCs**

NPCs suffer damage differently than PCs do, but that damage can scale according to how “hard,” skilled, trained or just plain dangerous the NPC is. For reference:

**_When an ordinary NPC suffers…_**

*   1-damage: cosmetic damage, pain, concussion, fear
*   2-damage: wounds, unconsciousness, bad pain, broken bones, shock, likely fatal
*   3-damage: 50-50 immediately fatal, otherwise terrible wounds, shock, death soon
*   4-damage: usually immediately fatal, sometimes mangled and ruined, waiting to die
*   5-damage and more: fatal and bodily destructive

**_When a “lieutenant”-grade NPC suffers damage_** reduce thedamage by 1 on the scale above for purposes of consequences only.

**_When a “captain”-grade NPC suffers damage_** reduce the damage by 2 on the scale above for purposes of consequences only.

When NPCs suffer `trauma`, they are stunned and unable to act for one round.

#### **Gangs**

If a move indicates, you have a gang of about a dozen hardened folks. By default: 2-damage gang small 1-armor, and choose 2:

*   Your gang consists of two dozen hardened folks. Medium instead of small
*   Your gang is well armed. +1 damage
*   Your gang has combat armor. +1 armor
*   Your gang has access to specialized weaponry. Add 1 Basic Weapon [tag](/content/tags)
*   Your gang has access to specialized morph upgrades. Add 1 Morph [tag](/content/tags)
*   Your gang is self-sufficient. `+rich`  
    

And choose 1:

*   Your gang is ill-supplied, -1 damage or -1 armo
*   Your gang is a pack of violent thugs. It gets `+savage`
*   Your gang is loose-knit, with members coming and going as they choose. `+desertion`.
*   Your gang owes a significant debt to someone powerful. `+obligation`
*   Your gang is lax about security and likes to drink and brag. `+reprisals`  
    

If you advance your gang, either gain a new option from the first list, or remove the option from the second list.

**_Gangs and Trauma_**  
When a Gang suffers trauma, reduce the gang’s effective size by 1 for the next round in battle.

#### **Vehicles and Starships**

Vehicles are machines capable of being driven or piloted by one or a small handful of people, and are usually habitat-bound. Vehicles operate on the same scale as characters do, and so their weapon statistics, if any, reflect use against people and other vehicles. The amount of damage that a vehicle has suffered has the following effects:

*   1-damage: cosmetic damage. 0-damage can blow through to passengers.
*   2-damage: functional damage. 1-damage can blow through to passengers.
*   3-damage: serious damage. 2-damage can blow through to passengers.
*   4-damage: breakdown. 3-damage can blow through to passengers.
*   5-damage and more: total destruction. Full damage can blow through to passengers, plus they can suffer additional harm if the vehicle explodes or crashes.

Starship-scale combat is beyond the scope of Eclipse Phase, and should be used for narrative and dramatic purposes. After all, it’s no fun if a ship the player characters are on explodes and they all die.

**Building Vehicles:**  
Vehicles are characterized by stat profile, frame, strength, looks, and weakness.
