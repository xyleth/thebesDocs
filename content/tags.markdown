## Tags

**_Tags_** are descriptors that attach to your character for a variety of reasons. Some, like `+boosted` are situational, granted temporarily due to circumstance. Some, such as `+cyberbrain` describe some aspect of your morph that is intrinsic to it. Others, such as `+pneumatic limbs`, are descriptive of some sort of mechanical or cybernetic enhancement. Some tags apply to equipment, such as the `+reload` tag.

Whatever the source, tags work the same way. They are a mostly descriptive, narrative thing that enables your character to do things they may not be ordinarily able to do, or they create some complication for your character to overcome.
