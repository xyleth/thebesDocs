### Starting Gear

In a world with nanofabrication technology, most basic gear is cheap to the point of being free. The only restricted items tend to be dangerous or require exotic raw materials. As a result, characters can start with pretty much any personal effects they desire. In addition, each character may start with four items or services that might otherwise be expensive or difficult to obtain.

Some examples:

- A basic weapon (see below)
- Some armour (no higher than 2-armour)
- An extra [morph](/content/morphs.html) tucked away somewhere, even an exotic morph
- Resleeving Insurance – pre-paid rebirth should you die
- A fully instanced alpha, beta, or delta fork of yourself
- A rare or exotic implant or upgrade
- Secrets about a particular faction
- Medical and field-triage equipment
- A favor or favors owed by a particular person or group

### Gear complexity

Every item of gear, service or Morph implant has an associated complexity. This serves to indicate if a **_Procure Something_** move is required to source it, and any modifiers to that roll. Gear may be unavailable due to circumstance, for example if there is no nanofabricator to hand or you are remote from suppliers of such things, but when they are available the following applies:

- **Minor (Min)** Common, simple items that can be produced by any naofabricator. Can be acquired in reasonable quantities with no **_Procure something_** move required
- **Moderate (Mod)** Less common items that take effort to track down, or more intricate items that require longer to nanofabricate. You are `boosted` on a **_Procure Something_** move to acquire this gear
- **Major (Maj)** Uncommon, expensive, and hard-to-find items or complex gear that takes substantial time to fabricate. Requires a **_Procure Something_** move to acquire.
- **Rare (Rare)** Unique, unusal, or highly valuable items may not be available or may require unusal feedstock for nanfobrication. You are `glitched` on a **_Procure Something_** move to acquire this gear.

Some items of gear are additionally classified as **_Restricted (R)_**. They are dangerous, illegal or frowned upon by the local community. These items cannot be acquired with a **_Procure Something_** move until you have discovered the proper contacts to provide you with such illicit contraband.

### Currency

There are two main systems of currency in the universe of Eclipse Phase. The first, used mostly in the inner system and with the hypercorps, is money, credits, and other physical goods reflected in the **_Resources_** stat. The second, used mostly in the outer system and amidst more anarchist groups, reflects a post-scarcity economy where physical goods are plentiful and a person’s time and reputation is the only unit of value. This is reflected in the **_Rep_** stat.

Both of these stats are fluid, and can fluctuate up or down due to events, purchases, and other influences. Both function essentially identically, but may be `boosted` or `glitched` depending on which stat you’re using with which individuals. Hypercorps will prefer Resources, while Anarchists will prefer Rep.

You may find your **_Resources_** and **_Rep_** diminishing as you stretch them in procuring things. You can increase those stats through [Advancement](/content/rules/advancement.html), [Moves](/content/moves.html) such as [Wealth](/content/moves/logistics.html#wealth) or [fame](/content/moves/social.html#fame), or through narrative events. The GM may award “Upvotes” or “Payouts,” which accumulate until spent. You can spend an Upvote to gain `+boosted`\-forward on your next Rep roll, or you can spend 3 Upvotes to increase your Rep stat by 1. You can spend a Payout to gain `+boosted`\-forward on your next Resources roll, or you can spend 3 Payouts to increase your Resources stat by 1. Upvotes and Payouts are freely transferable between characters.

Resources and Rep can go no higher than +3 and no lower than -2. If either stat reaches -2, you may no longer roll it until it increases to at least -1.

### Weapons

See [Weapons](/content/gear/weapons.html)

### Armour

Armour can either be worn by your morph or integrated. Most biomorphs don’t have built-in armour, whereas most synthmorphs, being made of metal and other durable substances, have an intrinsic armour value. In some circumstances, a morph with built-in armour may choose to wear additional armour. Only the higher armour value applies. Armour value may never exceed 3 regardless of the source.

Armour comes in three categories:

- Light armour (1-armour) is the most common, taking the form of clothing made of smart materials, subdermal implants, or simply being made out of durable materials.
- Combat armour (2-armour) tends to be bulky and obvious, taking forms like thick crab-like carapace, sealed suits of armour, or thick armour plating bolted to your chassis.
- Heavy armour (3-armour) is rare, found usually on dedicated combat synthmorphs and machines of war.

Armour of rating 2 or above must be procured with a [Procure Something](/content/moves/basicmoves.html#procure-something) move.

### Implants and Upgrades

The galaxy is full of hi-tech nanoware implants for biomorphs or software or hardware upgrades for synthmorphs. Rather than create an exhaustive list, simply check the list of **_[morph tags](/content/tags.html)_**. Each of them represents some form of upgrade that you can purchase or procure. Some tags are only applicable to biomorphs, others are only applicable to synthmorphs, and yet others have different tech that applies the same benefit to both types.

### Medical Supplies

Trained medical professionals, such as those with the **_[Battlefield Medic](/content/moves/combat.html#battlefield-medic)_** move, may use a medical kit in the following fashion:

Your kit has all kinds of stuff in it, like nanobandages and advanced biotech, represented by a “stock” score. A fresh, unopened medical kit as a stock score of 10. When you use it, spend its stock; you can spend 0–3 of its stock per use. You can resupply it with a **_procure something_** roll if your circumstances let you barter for medical supplies.

To use it to remove `+stunned`, roll+Stock spent. On a hit, they will stabilize and heal to their third `+scuffed` tag, and choose 2 (on a 10+) or 1 (on a 7–9):

- they fight you and you have to sedate them. How long will they be out?
- the pain and drugs make them babble the truth to you. Ask them what secret they spill.
- they respond very well to treatment. Recover 1 of the stock you spent, if you spent any.
- they’re at your complete mercy. What do you do to them?
- their course of recovery teaches you something about your craft. Mark experience.
- they owe you for your time, attention, and supplies, and you’re going to hold them to it.

On a miss, they mark one more off the [damage track](#damage-track)

To use it to revive someone who’s on death’s door (`Dead`, but not beyond, and not for long - they died in the current scene): spend 2-stock. Choose 1 of the above, and they come back, but you get to choose how they come back:

- they come back in your deep, deep debt
- they come back with -1 Hard
- they come back with -1 Reflex
- they come back with -1 Willpower

#### Nanobandages:

These useful devices are one-use emergency hives of nanomachines that can rapidly repair damaged tissue. **_When applying a nanobandage in battle_** roll+Cognition. On a 10+, heal two checks off the **_damage track_**. On a 7-9, heal one check. On a failure, the bandage is wasted and you may have made things worse.
