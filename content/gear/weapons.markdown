# Weapons

## Basic Weapons

Weaponry is immensely varied and exotic, with new templates being designed for nanofabrication all the time. Basic weapons are those that can be used by your average biomorph without the need for specialized implants or training. Rather than create an exhaustive weapon list, players and the GM are encouraged to develop their own weapons using the system below:

**_Base Stats_** 2-damage `+hand` (melee) or `+close` (ranged)

Add up to 3 of the following advantages:

- +1-damage
- +1-damage
- `+ap-1`
- `+autofire`
- `+bug`
- `+burn`
- `+capsule`
- `+far` instead of `+close`
- `+close/far` instead of `+close` (takes 2 choices)
- `+implanted`
- `+jammer`
- `+messy`
- `+seeker`
- `+shock`

And take up to 2 of the following flaws:

- `+bio`
- `+hi-tech`
- `+loud`
- `+recoil`
- `+reload` (cannot take with `+autofire`)
- `+synth`

The finished weapon must have no more than +1 net advantage.

**_Sample Basic Weapons:_**  
Cyberclaws (2-damage `+hand` `+implanted`)  
Monomolecular Sword (3-damage `+hand`)  
Vibroblade (3-damage `+hand` `+ap-1` `+hi-tech`)  
Shock Gloves (3-damage `+hand` `+shock` `+hi-tech`)  
Seeker Pistol (3-damage `+close` `+seeker` `+hi-tech`)  
Railgun Assault Rifle (3-damage `+close` `+autofire` `+hi-tech`)  
Flamethrower (2-damage `+close` `+burn` `+messy` `+reload`)  
Armor Piercing Heavy Pistol (4-damage `+close` `+ap-1` `+loud` `+reload`)  
Sniper Rifle (4-damage `+far` `+recoil` `+hi-tech`)  
Shotgun (3-damage `+close` `+messy` `+loud`)  
Light Machine Gun (2-damage `+close/far` `+autofire` `+loud` `+recoil`)  
Tranquilizer Rifle (2-damage `+far` `+bug` `+capsule` `+hi-tech` `+reload`)  
Microwave Agonizer (3-damage `+close` `+shock` `+autofire` `+bio` `+hi-tech`)

### Heavy Weapons

Heavy weapons require specialized training to use, and often a specialized [morph](/content/morphs.html) or a vehicle to mount them on. Anyone trying to use a heavy weapon without the **_[Heavy Weapon Training](/content/moves/combat.html#heavy-weapon-training)_** move must first successfully **_take a chance_** rolling+Hard.

Heavy weapons must be procured with a [Procure Something](/content/moves/basicmoves.html#procure-something) move.

Heavy weapons are created much like basic weapons, using the following choices:

**_Base Stats_** 3-damage `+close`

Add up to 3 of the following advantages:

- +1-damage
- +1-damage
- `+ap-1`
- `+ap-2` (takes 2 choices)
- `+area`
- `+burn`
- `+far` in addition to `+close`
- `+implanted` (combat synthmorphs only)
- `+seeker`

And take up to 2 of the following flaws:

- `+bio`
- `+hi-tech`
- `+loud`
- `+recoil`
- `+refill` (counts as 2 flaws)
- `+reload`
- `+synth`

The finished weapon must have no more than +1 net advantage.

**_Sample Heavy Weapons:_**  
Seeker Rocket Launcher (3-damage `+close` `+area` `+seeker` `+reload`)  
Heavy Railgun (4-damage `+close/far` `+hi-tech`)  
Reaper-Mounted Railgun (3-damage `+close/far` `+implanted` `+hi-tech`)  
Microwave Agonizer Cannon (4-damage `+close` `+shock` `+area` `+bio` `+hi-tech`)  
Plasma Cannon (4-damage `+close/far` `+burn` `+hi-tech` `+reload`)  
EMP Cannon (4-damage `+close` `+shock` `+area` `+synth` `+hi-tech`)
