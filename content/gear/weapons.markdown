# Weapons

## Range tags

See [A note on ranges](/content/rules/combat.html#a-note-on-ranges) for details. The range tags are:

- `+intimate`
- `+hand`
- `+close`
- `+close/far`
- `+far`

## Weapon Tags:

- `+ap` – Armor Piercing. Usually comes with a rating indicating how many points of **_armor_** the attack ignores (NPCs) or the penalty to your **_damage move_** (PCs).
- `+area` – A weapon with this tag can hit multiple targets in an area.
- `+autofire` – A weapon with this tag can make a single attack with the `+area` tag, but then gains the `+reload` tag.
- `+bio` – This weapon can only hurt biological targets
- `+bug` – This ammunition contains a tracking bug that monitors the condition and broadcasts the location of whatever its lodged in.
- `+burn` – A weapon with this tag sets things on fire.
- `+capsule` – This ammunition contains a payload of some drug (drugs procured separately)
- `+hi-tech` – This weapon is fiddly, or requires rare materials, or is in other ways less reliable
- `+jammer` – Ammunition disrupts wireless capability in any target it’s embedded in.
- `+messy` – This weapon may hit additional targets, friend or foe.
- `+recoil` – A weapon with this tag packs a punch, and must be set up in advance to use effectively.
- `+refill` – This weapon can only be fired once in your typical battle scene.
- `+reload` – A weapon with this tag needs to be reloaded after firing.
- `+seeker` – This weapon uses seeker ammunition which can track down a target and does not need to be precisely aimed.
- `+shock` – This weapon uses plastic ammunition, or perhaps has incapacitating electricity. Cannot inflict `+stunned`, `+wounded`, or `Dead`, although boxes are marked on the damage track anyway. Targets go unconscious when they would otherwise be `Dead`
- `+synth` – This weapon can only hurt synthetic targets.

## Basic Weapons

Weaponry is immensely varied and exotic, with new templates being designed for nanofabrication all the time. Basic weapons are those that can be used by your average biomorph without the need for specialized implants or training. Rather than create an exhaustive weapon list, players and the GM are encouraged to develop their own weapons using the system below:

**_Base Stats_** 2-damage `+hand` (melee) or `+close` (ranged)

Add up to 3 of the following advantages:

- +1-damage
- +1-damage
- `+ap-1`
- `+autofire`
- `+bug`
- `+burn`
- `+capsule`
- `+far` instead of `+close`
- `+close/far` instead of `+close` (takes 2 choices)
- `+implanted`
- `+jammer`
- `+messy`
- `+seeker`
- `+shock`

And take up to 2 of the following flaws:

- `+bio`
- `+hi-tech`
- `+loud`
- `+recoil`
- `+reload` (cannot take with `+autofire`)
- `+synth`

The finished weapon must have no more than +1 net advantage.

**_Sample Basic Weapons:_**  
Cyberclaws (2-damage `+hand` `+implanted`)  
Monomolecular Sword (3-damage `+hand`)  
Vibroblade (3-damage `+hand` `+ap-1` `+hi-tech`)  
Shock Gloves (3-damage `+hand` `+shock` `+hi-tech`)  
Seeker Pistol (3-damage `+close` `+seeker` `+hi-tech`)  
Railgun Assault Rifle (3-damage `+close` `+autofire` `+hi-tech`)  
Flamethrower (2-damage `+close` `+burn` `+messy` `+reload`)  
Armor Piercing Heavy Pistol (4-damage `+close` `+ap-1` `+loud` `+reload`)  
Sniper Rifle (4-damage `+far` `+recoil` `+hi-tech`)  
Shotgun (3-damage `+close` `+messy` `+loud`)  
Light Machine Gun (2-damage `+close/far` `+autofire` `+loud` `+recoil`)  
Tranquilizer Rifle (2-damage `+far` `+bug` `+capsule` `+hi-tech` `+reload`)  
Microwave Agonizer (3-damage `+close` `+shock` `+autofire` `+bio` `+hi-tech`)

### Heavy Weapons

Heavy weapons require specialized training to use, and often a specialized [morph](/content/morphs.html) or a vehicle to mount them on. Anyone trying to use a heavy weapon without the **_[Heavy Weapon Training](/content/moves/combat.html#heavy-weapon-training)_** move must first successfully **_take a chance_** rolling+Hard.

Heavy weapons must be procured with a [Procure Something](/content/moves/basicmoves.html#procure-something) move.

Heavy weapons are created much like basic weapons, using the following choices:

**_Base Stats_** 3-damage `+close`

Add up to 3 of the following advantages:

- +1-damage
- +1-damage
- `+ap-1`
- `+ap-2` (takes 2 choices)
- `+area`
- `+burn`
- `+far` in addition to `+close`
- `+implanted` (combat synthmorphs only)
- `+seeker`

And take up to 2 of the following flaws:

- `+bio`
- `+hi-tech`
- `+loud`
- `+recoil`
- `+refill` (counts as 2 flaws)
- `+reload`
- `+synth`

The finished weapon must have no more than +1 net advantage.

**_Sample Heavy Weapons:_**  
Seeker Rocket Launcher (3-damage `+close` `+area` `+seeker` `+reload`)  
Heavy Railgun (4-damage `+close/far` `+hi-tech`)  
Reaper-Mounted Railgun (3-damage `+close/far` `+implanted` `+hi-tech`)  
Microwave Agonizer Cannon (4-damage `+close` `+shock` `+area` `+bio` `+hi-tech`)  
Plasma Cannon (4-damage `+close/far` `+burn` `+hi-tech` `+reload`)  
EMP Cannon (4-damage `+close` `+shock` `+area` `+synth` `+hi-tech`)
