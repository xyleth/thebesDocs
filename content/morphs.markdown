Your Morph is the body that your [Ego](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/ego) is inhabiting at any given time. It could be the physical body you were born with, or perhaps a robotic shell youâ€™re occupying temporarily. Your Morph determines your capabilities in the physical world, with some secondary influence over your social interactions.

Some morphs are strong. Some are fast, some are smart. Some morphs are looked down upon and grant the `+stigmatized` tag. Others are so unearthly in their beauty and perfection that you get bonuses to all social interaction. Your [Background](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/background) determines which morph you may start play with, but after that, you are limited only by circumstance and resources should you wish to resleeve into a new morph.

See sub-pages for the available morphs, subject to the MC and actual local availability. At the time of writing this list is considered the canonical list of game allowable morphs. If a morph on the sub-pages of this one isn't on this list it doesn't exist. If a morph on this list isn't in those pages, it should be added. Eventually this will cease to be an issue.

## Common Morphs

The following morphs do not require you to make the **_Procure Something_** move. This is not the same as availability - a morph can be on this list and still unavailable in your location. But if it is available, you don't have to roll for it.
