# Trauma and Healing

Trauma is damage inflicted to your psyche by mind bending events that are all too common After the Fall. Exposure to extreme violence, the death of those close to you, encounters with the TITANS and their minions: all of these and more can whittle away at your sanity.

Trauma is tracked via the [Sanity Track](#sanity-track).

## Sanity Track

\[\] `+odd`
\[\] `+odd`
\[\] `+odd`
\[\] `+eccentric`
\[\] `+disassociated`
\[\] `Insane`

Each of these applies the respective [tag](/content/tags/damage-trauma.html) to your character. For ease of reference these tags are reproduced here:

- `+odd` – You’re a bit off, no game mechanical detriment
- `+eccentric` – Gain the [Eccentric](/content/moves/personal#Eccentric) move
- `+disassociated` – You are `+glitched` on all **_trauma move_** rolls.
- `Insane` – Not a tag, so much, as a state of being. You are unrecoverably insane. Retire your character.

## Trauma

At the GMs direction (via spending hold), or as a consequence of your or another's move, you may be asked to roll the [Trauma Move](#trauma-move) as below.

## Trauma Move

When you **_experience horror, a loss of continuity, or an ego-hacking attempt_**, roll+Willpower. On a 10+, you shake it off to no effect. On a 7-9, the GM chooses 1:

- You lose your grip on, or otherwise damage whatever you’re holding. Lose an item of gear.
- You reel from the trauma. `+glitched` ongoing until the situation is more clear.
- You panic and take a single concrete action of the GM’s choosing.

On a miss, mark 1 off the Sanity track.

## Healing Trauma

Trauma is much harder to heal than damage to your morph. As damage to your very psyche it persists with your Ego and travels with you from morph to morph.

- You can get someone to perform [Psychosurgery](/content/moves/tech.html#psychosurgery) on your ego
- You can allow an async to perform the [Downtime](/content/moves/psi.html#downtime) move on you
- You can wait it out, working on it with the aid of your Muse or an external Therapist

For the latter option you can cure one box of `odd` per month of Therapy in which you do not accrue any further trauma. `eccentric` takes three months of uninterrupted therapy to heal before you can start on the `odd` boxes. `disassociated` requires Psychosurgery or the Downtime move as above.
