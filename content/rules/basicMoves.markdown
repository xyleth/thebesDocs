# Basic Moves

All characters have access to all Basic Moves:

**Access the Mesh**  
You may only **_access the mesh_** if you have an ecto (personal computer) or your [Morph](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/morph) has `+mesh inserts`. When you need to know something quickly, roll+Cognition. On 10+, you get the information you need in the nick of time. On 7-9, you get something related, if not entirely on point.

**Aid/Hinder**  
When you **_take the time to aid or hinder another PC_**, they are `+boosted` or `+glitched`, your choice, but you share in any consequences of their action. Only one person may Aid/Hinder any given action.

**Assess the Situation**  
When you **_cast your gaze over a charged situation or interaction_** roll+Intuition. On 10+, hold 2. On a 7-9, hold 1. You may spend your hold, one for one, at any point in that scene to:

*   Ask the GM any one question about the situation
*   Ask a question about another character in the scene
*   Name your way in/around/through/out. You are `+boosted` to get there
*   Name the most important character on the scene (your call). You are `+boosted` forward with or against them.

**Negotiate**  
When you **_have leverage over someone_** (something they need, want, or wish to hide) and **_wish to get something from them_**, roll+Savvy. For NPCs, on a hit, they ask for something before they do what you want, and if you promise, they’ll do it. On a 7-9, they need some concrete assurance, now.  
For PCs, on a 10+, both, on a 7-9, choose 1:

*   If they do it, they mark experience.
*   If they don’t, they’re `+glitched` ongoing until they’re out of your presence.

**Open Fire**  
When you **_attack an enemy at range_**, roll+Coordination. On 10+, you hit and inflict damage. On 7-9, you hit, but there is a complication (choose 1):

*   You need to move, exposing yourself to danger
*   You burn through ammo. Add the `+reload` tag (only if your weapon does not already have it)
*   You only graze the target (-1 damage)
*   You take some return fire. Roll the **_damage move_**.

On a miss, you may hit something important, or an ally if firing into melee

**Procure Something**  
When you **_want something and it’s not immediately obvious that you can just get it_**, roll+Resources or +Rep (your choice). On a 10+, you get it, no strings attached, and your resources or rep doesn’t take a hit. On a 7-9, you can either get something pretty close, with strings attached, without risk, or you can get exactly what you want, but the stat you rolled drops permanently by 1. On a miss, you get something close, with strings very much attached, and the stat you rolled drops permanently by 1.

Note: This move may be `+glitched` or even `+degraded` if you try to use the wrong stat among the wrong people, or if an item is particularly rare or expensive. You cannot roll this move with a stat that is at -2. You must wait for it to increase back to at least -1 before attempting to procure something with it.

**Skirmish**  
When you **_engage in melee combat_**, take your enemy’s damage and roll+Somatics. On a hit, you inflict your damage. On a 10+, choose two. On a 7-9, choose one:

*   You demoralize your foe
*   You defend yourself effectively. You’re `+boosted` on your **_damage move_**.
*   You get in a solid blow (+1 damage)
*   You achieve some tactical objective. Name it

If you are engaging another PC in melee, they make your choices for you.

**Take a Chance**  
When you **_take action despite consequences for failure_**, you must roll. The Stat you add depends on how you’re addressing the risk. If you’re:

*   Counting on agility or fine motor control, roll+Coordination.
*   Counting on physical strength or endurance, roll+Somatics.
*   Methodically planning your course, roll+Cognition.
*   Flashing a smile and banking on your charm, roll+Savvy.

On a hit you succeed and accomplish your task. On 7-9, however, the GM chooses one:

*   You expose yourself to trauma, harm, or retaliation
*   You miss noticing something important
*   You attract additional unwanted attention
*   You have to make a hard choice, the GM will let you know what it is

**Integration, Alienation, and Continuity**  
When you **_resleeve into a new morph_**, it takes a while to adjust to your new physicality. Roll+Somatics. On a 10+, you integrate with aplomb. On a 7-9, you’re `+glitched` forward. On a failure, you’re `+glitched` ongoing until the GM decides you’ve sufficiently adjusted. This roll may be `+boosted` if your new morph is identical or nearly identical to the old one, or `+glitched` if the new morph is dramatically different in some way. The GM may skip the Integration roll if resleeving into an infomorph.

Once you get your new body under control, it’s time to look in the mirror and adjust to the new you mentally. Roll+Cognition. On a 10+, you adapt with little alienation. On a 7-9, you’re `+glitched` forward. On a failure, you’re `+glitched` ongoing until the GM decides you’ve sufficiently adjusted. This roll may be `+boosted` if your new morph is identical or nearly identical to the old one, or `+glitched` if the new morph is dramatically different in some way.

Finally, you must get used to any loss of continuity, or adapt to the idea that you may not be the only version of yourself out there. Roll the **_trauma move_**. This roll may be `+boosted` or `+glitched`, depending on the circumstances of your resleeving, even `+degraded` if the loss of time is too great. The GM may skip the continuity roll if there is no significant loss of time.

**Damage Move**  
When you **_take physical damage_** from something, roll+Armor. On a 10+, you absorb or avoid the blow entirely. On a 7-9, the GM chooses 1:

*   You lose your footing. `+glitched` ongoing until you can regain it.
*   You lose your grip on, or otherwise damage whatever you’re holding. Lose an item of gear.
*   You lose track of someone or something you’re attending to.
*   It’s a glancing blow. Mark 1 off the **_damage track_**.

On a miss, you suffer the full brunt of the damage.

**Trauma Move**  
When you **_experience horror, a loss of continuity, or an ego-hacking attempt_**, roll+Willpower. On a 10+, you shake it off to no effect. On a 7-9, the GM chooses 1:

*   You lose your grip on, or otherwise damage whatever you’re holding. Lose an item of gear.
*   You reel from the trauma. `+glitched` ongoing until the situation is more clear.
*   You panic and take a single concrete action of the GM’s choosing.

On a miss, mark 1 off the Sanity track.
