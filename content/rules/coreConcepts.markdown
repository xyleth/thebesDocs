# Core Concepts

**The Narrative**  
The narrative is all important. This is the fiction generated between the Player Characters (PCs) and the Game Master (GM). The PCs describe what their characters are doing, saying, sometimes even thinking. The GM describes how the world reacts to the PCs. If there’s some question about the outcome of events, the players roll dice to determine the outcome using one of their **_moves_** (see below). The GM then can respond with one of his **_moves_** based on the outcome of the die roll. Moves are both prescriptive and descriptive. If the narrative fiction would disallow a move, that move isn’t allowed. If a move creates certain narrative outcomes, those outcomes happen. Go with the flow.

**Stats**  
Each character has 6 Stats associated with their [Ego](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/ego) :  
**_Cognition_** – Your mind’s ability to find and apply information quickly.  
**_Intuition_** – Your mind’s ability to efficiently process external stimuli  
**_Coordination_** – Your ego’s ability to fully integrate with your morph for fine motor skills  
**_Somatics_** – Your ego’s ability to control your morph for physical optimization, strength, and hardiness  
**_Savvy_** – Your personality’s ability to smoothly interact with others  
**_Willpower_** – Your ego’s stability, resistance to degradation over time

Characters also have 2 Stats associated with their [Background](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/background):  
**_Rep_** – Your personality’s aggregate reputation among all social media  
**_Resources_** – Your access to wealth in the form of credits and other physical assets

[Ego](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/ego) stats are static, unless improved through [Advancement](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/advancement). [Background](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/background) stats, however, will fluctuate permanently as you rely on your Resources or Rep to procure goods or services, and as you perform actions that increase your Resources and Rep.

**Moves**  
Game mechanics are expressed as “Moves.” Most moves require you to “roll `+(Stat)`” wherein you roll 2d6 and add the appropriate stat. A 10+ is a total success, a 7-9 is a partial success, granting the GM some power to complicate matters, and a 6- is a failure, granting the GM even more power to make the narrative go in ways not altogether to your liking. The GM never rolls dice, but rather reacts entirely to your die rolls as appropriate to the fiction.

**_Roll Modifiers_**  

*   `+(n)forward` = apply “n” to your next die roll.
*   `+(n)ongoing` = apply “n” to all die rolls until the situation granting the bonus goes away.
*   `+boosted` = die rolls that result in 6- are raised to 7. You cannot fail. If you are `boosted` from more than one source, you are now `+elevated`.
*   `+elevated` = die rolls that result in 6- become a 7-9. Die rolls that are 7-9 become 10+. Die rolls at 10+ become 12.
*   `+glitched` = die rolls that result in 10+ are reduced to 9. You cannot fully succeed. If you are `glitched` from more than one source, you are now `+degraded`.
*   `+degraded` = die rolls that result in a 10+ are reduced to 7-9. Die rolls that are 7-9 are reduced to 6-.

**_Exceptional Success_**  
If the roll on a move is 12+, it counts as an **_exceptional success_**. The GM and the player are encouraged to come up with some manner in which the character succeeds even more stylishly or effectively than normal.

**_Modifier Cancellation_**  
If your roll is modified by both a `+boosted` tag, and a `+glitched` tag, they cancel each other out and you roll normally. If your `+elevated` die roll is `+glitched`, it becomes merely `+boosted`.

**Hold**  
A number of moves generate a “currency” called **_hold_**. If you roll that move and generate one or more points of hold, you can spend those points at an appropriate point later in the narrative to achieve an effect as determined by the move. The GM also collects hold over PCs whenever a PC fails a roll. This hold can be used to activate [GM Moves](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/gm-moves).

**Damage and Sanity**  
You have two condition tracks corresponding to the physical damage taken by your [Morph](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/morph) and your long-term sanity. Each level of the condition track has a [Tag](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/tags) associated with it.

**_Damage Track_**

**_Sanity Track_**

\[\] `+scuffed`

\[\] `+odd`

\[\] `+scuffed`

\[\] `+odd`

\[\] `+scuffed`

\[\] `+odd`

\[\] `+stunned`

\[\] `+eccentric`

\[\] `+wounded`

\[\] `+dissassociated`

\[\] `Dead`

\[\] `Insane`

When you take physical damage, you will roll the **_damage move_**. When you suffer mental trauma from horror or an ego-hacking attempt, you will roll the **_trauma move_**. Both of these moves are [Basic Moves](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/basic-moves).

Damage can be healed with medical attention. Sanity can never be healed except through [Psychosurgery](https://eclipse-phase-apocalypse.obsidianportal.com/wikis/moves#Psychosurgery) or taking certain [Advances](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/advancement).

**Battle**  
When you engage in a full-on battle (not just some random violence) the narrative becomes more formal. Each “round” of battle represents a discrete narrative segment. In each round, every player can describe a single narrative action that their character takes. This action can involve the use of one or more moves. There are special [Battle Moves](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/battle-moves) that become available only in Battle. Also, a number of other moves specify that they are rolled when you **_go into battle_**. These moves are rolled at the beginning of the Battle.

The GM has two special moves that he can use to simulate the escalating tension and danger of a battle. The moves are **_inflict incidental fire_** and **_inflict concentrated fire_**. The GM may use these moves at the end of any round of battle, against any PC, as appropriate according to the narrative. In general, the GM should **_inflict incidental fire_** in the first couple of rounds, and **_inflict concentrated fire_** in later rounds, but if a PC does something particularly brave or foolhardy, the GM is encouraged to unleash whatever incoming harm the PC deserves.

When the GM **_inflicts incidental fire_**, the PC rolls the **_damage move_** or **_trauma move_** (as appropriate to the nature of the fire) and is `+boosted` on the roll.

When the GM **_inflicts concentrated fire_**, the PC rolls the **_damage move_** or **_trauma move_** without modifier, as normal.

Note: If the GM has also spent **_hold_**, or or the PC took damage from some other source that round, it is entirely possible that a PC may have to roll a damage move more than once in a round.
