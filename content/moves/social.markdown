## Artful & Gracious

When you perform your chosen art – any act of expression or culture – or when you put its product before an audience, roll+Savvy. On a 10+, spend 3. On a 7-9, spend 1. Spend 1 to name an NPC member of your audience and choose one:

- This person must meet me
- This person must have my services
- This person loves me
- This person must give me a gift
- This person admires my patron

On a miss, you gain no benefit. You simply perform very well.

## Dangerous and Sexy

When you enter into a charged situation, roll+Savvy. On a 10+, hold 2. On a 7-9, hold 1. Spend your hold 1 for 1 to make eye contact with an NPC present, who freezes or flinches and can’t take action until you break it off. On a miss, your enemies identify you immediately as their foremost threat.

## Emotion Suppression:

Whenever someone else **_assesses a situation_** and spends hold to ask a question about your character, you may answer their question in any way you wish, even if it’s not true. This move can be gained for free through certain implants such as `+endocrine control`.

## Fame

You’re a famous personality, and your XP exploits are followed by many. You get 2-juggling, 3 paying gigs, and 1 obligation gig. Whenever there’s a stretch of downtime in play, or between sessions, choose a number of your gigs to work. Choose no more than your juggling. Roll+Savvy. On a 10+, you get profit from each of the gigs you chose. On a 7-9, you get profit from one of your gigs; if you chose more gigs, you get catastrophe from the rest. On a miss, catastrophe all around. The gigs you aren’t working give you neither hold nor catastrophe, but if you avoid your obligation gig, the GM gets one hold over you. Whenever you get a new gig, you also get +1juggling.

Choose 3 paying gigs (upvote / catastrophe):

- Art (1-hold / critiqued)
- Bodyguarding (1-hold / embattled)
- Counter-espionage (1-hold / infiltrated)
- Deliveries (1-hold / bushwhacked)
- Enforcement (1-hold / overthrown)
- Espionage (1-hold / deceived)
- Extreme Sports (1-hold / injured)
- Infiltration (1-hold / discovered)
- Mercenary Work (1-hold / embattled)
- Murder for hire (2-hold / embattled)
- Sex (1-hold / entangled)

And choose 1 obligation gig: (upvote / catastrophe)

- Avoiding Someone (You keep well clear / they catch you in a bad spot)
- Paying debts (you keep up with them / they come due)
- Protecting someone (nothing bad happens to them / they’re gone)
- Pursuing luxury (beauty in your life / you wind up in a bad spot)
- Maintaining your rep (you keep your reputation / you cross a line)
- Seeking answers (you get a clue / you chase a red herring)

You may spend any upvote hold, 1-for-1, to gain +1forward to a **_procure something_** roll. Alternately, you may spend 3-hold to increase your Rep by 1.

For advancement, gain +2 gigs, or +1 gig and remove your obligation gig.

## Kinesics Specialist

You have kinesics training, supported by specialized software packages. **_When you have a one-on-one interactions with someone where you can see each others’ body language_** roll+Savvy. On a 10+ hold 2, on a 7-9, hold 1. You may spend your hold at any time during the interaction to:

- automatically know when they lie or try to misdirect you.
- conceal from them your own motives or intentions
- communicate an idea or concept entirely non-verbally in a manner unlikely to be intercepted

Synthmorphs, some uplifts, and AGIs can be particularly difficult to read. The GM may impose `+glitched` when interacting with such people. Individuals with `+endocrine control` or [Emotion Suppression](https://eclipse-phase-apocalypse.obsidianportal.com/wikis/moves#Emotion) are generally immune to this move.

## Life of the Party

When you hit the club or work a crowd, roll EITHER +Resources OR +Rep. On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7–9, choose 1. On a miss, you still choose one, but things get really out of hand (the GM will say how).

- You befriend a useful NPC.
- You hear rumors of an opportunity.
- You gain useful information.
- You are not entangled, conned, or tricked.

## Memetic Engineer

It’s one thing to convince a person of something. It’s another to engineer social acceptance of an idea. Mimetic engineers are masters of marketing, psychology and social networks, manipulating public opinion on every scale. When you **_engineer a meme_** describe to the GM what you seek to accomplish and roll+Savvy. On a hit, your meme is a success. On a 10+ choose 1. On a 7-9, choose 2:

- The meme takes extensive marketing and placement where people can see it. Permanently lose 1 point of **_Resources_**.
- The meme requires a lot of finessed word-of-mouth. Permanently lose 1 point of **_Rep_**.
- The meme is catchy, but easily forgotten. It won’t last very long
- The meme is durable but controversial and subject to counter-mimetics.

Social engineering is an imperfect science, and results are rarely permanent.

## Networker

When you collect gossip about someone important (your call), roll+Savvy. On a hit, you can ask the GM questions. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7-9, ask 1:

- How are they doing? What’s up with them?
- What or who do they love best?
- Who do they know, like and/or trust?
- When next should I expect to see them?
- How could I get to them, physically or emotionally?

## Reputation

When you meet someone important (your call), roll+Rep. On a hit, they’ve heard of you, and you say what they’ve heard; the GM will have them respond accordingly. On a 10+, you are `+boosted` for dealing with them as well. On a miss, they’ve heard of you, but the GM will decide what they’ve heard.
