## Cerulean Moves

#### **Cerulean Moves**

The following moves require the `+cerulean` tag.

**_Echoes of Self_**  
When you **_synch with your forks_** regardless of distance roll+Willpower. On a hit, you are them, briefly. Know what they know and they know what you know. On a 7-9 it’s disorienting and you’re `+glitched` forward. On a miss you just get the bad stuff. Roll the **_trauma move_**

**_Entropic Destiny_**  
When you **_increase localized entropy_** roll+Willpower. On a 10+ hold 3, on a 7-9, hold 1. At any point in the scene, you may spend your hold, 1 for 1, to:

- Cellular Decay: inflict 2-damage, `ap-2`, on someone in the scene
- Power Drain: drain the power from any one power source, including energy weapons, generators, someone’s `+mesh inserts`, etc.
- Thermal Degradation: remove all thermal energy from the room inflicting 1-damage `+ap-1`, `+area`, `+bio`

**_Probability Sight_**  
When you **_go into combat or a charged situation_** roll+Intuition. On a hit, name one NPC on the scene and say whether they will die or survive. The GM will do everything possible to make it happen. On a 10+, you are `+boosted` forward. On a miss, you’ve misinterpreted causality and are `+glitched` forward.

**_Signal Compatibility_**  
When in the presence of others with the `+cerulean` tag, all of you may communicate instantaneously with one another mentally, sharing concepts and linking minds. To **_communicate mentally with someone_** who does not have the `+cerulean` tag, roll+Willpower. On a hit, you can send some mental words and ideas. On a 10+, you can receive their responding surface thoughts whether they want you to or not.

**_Signal Interference_**  
When **_facing those infected by the exsurgent virus_**, roll+Willpower. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. At any point in the scene you may spend your hold, 1 for 1, to:

- Instantly kill any exsurgent (including asyncs)
- Shield any one person from exsurgent infection or async sleights for a scene
- Suppress the virus: Allow an infected person (including an async) to be temporarily free of the virus for a scene.
