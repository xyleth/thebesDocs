## Body Hopper  
You never need to roll **_integration, alienation, and continuity_** as a result of voluntary resleeving. Resleeving after death, or being restored from backup requires **_integration, alienation, and continuity_** as normal.

## Break and Enter  
You are talented at gaining access to places you have no business being. When you attempt to enter or exit such a place, roll+Intuition. On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7-9, choose 2:

- You get where you wanted to be
- You remain undetected while getting there.
- You leave no trace of ever having been there
- You stumble across something useful or interesting along the way.

## Disguise
When you have time and materials, you may disguise yourself as another individual of about the same size and shape. This disguise will pass all but a close physical examination (going beyond a simple pat-down). Simply posing as another random individual takes only moments and access to alternate clothing or a similar physical distraction. Posing as a particular individual requires considerable time, study and resources as determined by the MC.

## Eccentric
Your motivations are not always clear to others, or even beneficial to them or to you. Whenever you take an action that is a detriment to the group, mark Experience.  
**_Note:_** The `+eccentric` tag on your **_sanity track_** grants you this move for free.

## Expertise  
When you take this move, choose any other move you have that requires a die-roll. From now on, whenever you roll that move, you are `boosted`. You may take Expertise more than once, assigning each new version to a different move.

## Fitness  
Gain 2 new `+scuffed` boxes on your **_damage track_**.

## In the Thick of Things  
At the beginning of the session, roll+Intuition. On a 10+, hold 2. On a 7-9, hold 1. At any time, either you or the GM can spend your hold to have you show up in any scene, with the proper tools and knowledge. On a miss, the GM holds 1, and can spend it to have you already be there, but somehow pinned, caught or trapped.

## Mercurial Mindset
You take pride in your differences from humanity. You must be `+stigmatized` to use this move. Whenever you take an action or public stance that highlights your nature to your own social detriment, mark experience.

## Paragon  
You have a reputation as a beacon of hope, or perhaps a ruthless badass. When you share with another player’s character your vision and your methods, roll+Rep. On a 10+, hold 2 over them. On a 7-9, hold 1 over them. Whenever you like, you can spend your hold, 1 for 1, to have them mark experience, typically for taking actions that follow your example. On a miss, they hold 1 over you, on the same terms.

## Retribution  
Whenever you or an ally becomes `Dead`, you are `+boosted` ongoing to all rolls versus those responsible, forever. (All rolls with them directly as a target count, of course. Rolls against their family and friends, minions, or property may count, in the GM’s judgment.)

## Team Player  
When you **_aid another_** you are `+boosted` forward as well.

## Tough in the Fiber  
When you **_fail the damage move_** (roll a 6-) take one less damage than you normally would.
