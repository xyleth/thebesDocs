## Battlefield Medic

When you are caring for people, not fighting, you get +1 armor. You have a supply of nanobandages and other basic medical supplies. See [Gear](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/gear)

## Berserker:

When you **_charge into battle_** with no regard for your own safety or survival, gain +1 armor. When you are doing so while leading a gang, they all get +1 armor.

## Disciplined Engagement

When you inflict damage, you can choose to inflict any amount of damage you like, less than or up to your damage as established. Decide at the moment you inflict the damage; you need not tell anyone in advance how much damage you intend to inflict.

## Fire Control

When you **_go into battle_** roll+Cognition. On a 10+, hold 2. On a 7-9, hold 1. During the battle, you may spend your hold, one for one, to add or remove a weapon tag from any weapon you’re carrying.

## Heavy Weapon Training:

You can use heavy weapons without needing to **_take a chance_** first.

## Impossible Reflexes

The way you move unencumbered counts as armor. If you’re naked or nearly naked, 2-armor; if you’re wearing non-armor fashion, 1-armor. If you’re wearing armor, use it instead.

## Inspiring Leader

When you use words or deeds to inspire your people, roll+Savvy. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. At any time, you can spend your hold 1 for 1 to:

- Give someone under your command +1forward.
- Give someone under your command +1-armor for 1 round of battle.
- Give someone under your command +1 damage for 1 round of battle..

## Knife in the Dark

When you attack from hiding or from a circumstance prepared by you in advance, your damage is `+ap 1`

## Last Stand

When you **_stand your ground against overwhelming odds_**, roll+Willpower. On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7-9, choose 1:

- You create an opportunity for others (your call) to escape.
- You are `+boosted` for as long as you continue to stand your ground.
- Your position is counted as secure for as long as you choose to hold it.
- You are not overwhelmed at the end of the round, and `Dead`.

## Marksman:

When you get a hit on **_open fire_**, select one:

- damage or destroy a specific body part or held item
- create a tactical opportunity and immediately follow up on it
- disable them, all damage grants the `+scuffed` tag, and `Dead` becomes `Unconscious` instead

## Martial Artist

You do +1 damage when unarmed or armed with melee weapons

## Merciless

When you do damage, do +1 damage.

## Not to be Fucked With:

In battle, you count as a small gang with damage and armor appropriate to your equipment and moves.

## Packing All Kinds of Heat:

When you **_go into battle_**, choose one of the following:

- You’ve loaded incendiary ammunition. Add `+burn` to your ranged weapon attacks.
- You’ve loaded armor-piercing ammunition. Add `+ap-1` to your ranged weapon attacks.
- You’ve loaded plastic ammunition. Add `+shock` to your ranged weapon attacks.
- You’ve loaded tracking ammunition. Add `+bug` to your ranged weapon attacks

## Squad Leader

When you lead a gang into battle, it counts as one size larger than it is.
