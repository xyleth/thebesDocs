**_All My Vices Are Devices_**  
At the beginning of game, roll+Resources. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. You can spend your hold 1 for 1, at any time, to have a piece of tech useful to whatever situation you find yourself in – either on-hand, or somewhere you can get at it without too much trouble. This won’t get you weapons, but it might get you just about anything else man-portable and high-tech.

**_Cyberbrain Hacking_**  
When you hack a `+cyberbrain` or a `+virtual` person in a charged situation roll+Cognition. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. You can spend your hold 1 for 1 at any time to…

- Make the target’s attack miss its mark – it strikes someone other than the intended target, or a wall, or the ground.
- Extract one discrete piece of information from the target.
- Impress, dismay, or frighten the target.
- Overload the target. Inflict 2 **_damage_** per hold spent.
- Take over their body (`+puppet sock` only). They can try to resist by rolling+Willpower in subsequent rounds. 10+ throws off your control, 7-9 contests control, and failure leaves control in your hands.

You cannot use this move if you have unspent hold from this move.

**_Hacker_**  
When you seek to subvert a non-informorph computer system or electronic security measures, roll+Intuition. On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7-9, choose 2. On a miss, choose 1 anyway.

- You get into the system or past the security
- You don’t alert anyone to your intrusion
- You leave no trace behind
- You don’t permanently damage something important

**_Mechanic_**  
You are skilled with your hands and can fix, repair, or build pretty much anything. You have a dedicated workspace for larger projects, and an ability to repair things on the fly.

Workspace: Choose 3: a garage or cargo hold, a darkroom, skilled labor, a collection of raw materials, a cargo vehicle, high-tech gadgets, advanced tools, transmitters & receivers, an alien relic, high security.

When you **_go into your workspace_** and dedicate yourself to making a thing, or to getting to the bottom of something technological, decide what you’re doing and tell the GM. The GM will tell you “sure, no problem, but…” and then 1 to 4 of the following:

- It’s going to take hours/days/weeks/months of work
- First you’ll have to get/build/fix/figure out (something)
- You’re going to need (someone) to help you with it
- It’s going to cost you a ton of resources
- The best you’ll be able to do is a crap version, weak and unreliable
- It’s going to mean exposing yourself and colleagues to serious danger
- You’re going to have to add (something) to your workspace first
- It’s going to take several/dozens/hundreds of tries
- You’re going to have to take (something) apart to do it.

The GM might connect them all with “and,” or might throw in a merciful “or.” Once you’ve accomplished the necessaries, you can go ahead and accomplish the thing itself.

You can repair synthetic morphs with this move.

**_Medical Miracle-worker_**  
You are a master of all things biological, medical, and cybernetic. You may work on people or other biological specimens as if you were a **_Mechanic_**.

Laboratory: Choose 3: a med-bay or cargo hold, a surgery, skilled labor, growth vats of raw materials, an ambulance vehicle, high-tech gadgets, advanced life-support systems, top-notch cybernetic implant supply, an alien relic, high security.

You may **_go into your laboratory_** using the same rules as a **_mechanic_** going into their workspace.

You can use this move to heal biomorphs.

**_Nanovirus Fabricator_**  
Name somebody who might conceivably eat, drink, breathe or otherwise ingest something you’ve touched and roll+Cognition. On a 10+, they do, and become `Dead` in some nasty way sometime during the next 24 hours. On a 7-9, they’re merely badly injured or out of action. On a miss, some several people of the GM’s choice, maybe including your guy maybe not, get it.

**Psychosurgery:**  
When you **_engage in psychosurgery_** upon a neural backup, fork, AGI, or emulated ego in your carefully controlled simulspace, roll+Cognition. On a 10+, choose 2 (the same choice can be taken twice). On a 7-9, choose 1:

- Fork Integration: re-integrate a fork successfully
- Memory Editing: alter, or delete any one memory or related set of memories
- Behavioral modification: edit or delete certain behaviors or impulses
- Deep Learning: Grant the subject 1 Experience.
- Interrogation: Learn the complete answer to any one question
- Psychotherapy: Add or Remove one check from the **_Sanity Track_**.
- Take Care: Grant the subject `+boosted` on the subsequent **_trauma move_** (see below)

The subject then rolls the **_trauma move_**. In addition to the normal effects, on a 10+, the subject may choose whether to keep the changes or reject them. On a 7-9, the changes take effect, but the subject may choose one change that is only temporary. It will fade in a few weeks. On a failure, the changes take effect permanently, and the subject marks one check on the **_sanity track_** as normal.
