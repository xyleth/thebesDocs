## Psi Moves

#### **Psi Moves**

**_Note:_** You may only take these moves if you have the `+psi` tag. Psi moves only affect biomorphs, and can only be used if your ego is inhabiting a biomorph.

**Impulse:**  
In battle, you can use your psychic training as a weapon with (n-damage ap-2 close/far), where n- is equal to your **_Willpower_**.

**_Psi-Chi Sleights:_**  
At the start of the game session, roll+Willpower. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. At any time during that session you can spend your hold, 1-for-1, to apply one of the following tags to yourself for a single scene.

- `+circadian regulation`
- `+enhanced (sense)`
- `+oxygen reserves`
- `+reflex booster`
- `+temperature tolerance`
- `+toxin filters`

**Psi-Chi Reception:**  
When you **_assess a situation_** and you spend hold to ask a question about a person in the scene, you get the following information, in addition, for free:

- dominant emotional state
- honesty or dishonesty

**_Psi-Gamma Domination:_**  
When you **_dominate a person in a biomorph_**, roll+Willpower. On a 10+, hold 2, on a 7-9, hold 1. At any time, spend your hold 1 for 1 to:

- Make the target’s attack miss its mark – it strikes someone other than the intended target, or a wall, or the ground.
- Impress, dismay, or frighten the target.
- Overload the target. Inflict 3 **_damage_** per hold spent.
- Take over their body. They can try to resist by rolling+Willpower in subsequent rounds. 10+ throws off your control, 7-9 contests control, and failure leaves control in your hands.

You cannot use this move if you have unspent hold from this move.

**Psi-Gamma Scan:**  
When you take time and physical intimacy with someone – this can be one-sided if you need or wish, you just need time and touch – you may roll+Willpower to read them in-depth. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. While you’re reading them, spend your hold to ask them questions, 1 for 1…

- What was your character’s lowest or highest moment?
- For what does your character crave forgiveness, and of whom?
- What are your character’s secret pains or joys?
- What are your character’s greatest dreams or ambitions?
- What does your character hold closest to his heart?

On a miss, your subject rolls the **_trauma move_**

**Psi-Gamma Sleights:**  
When you psychically alter the perceptions of those around you, roll+Willpower. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. You can spend your hold 1 for 1 at any time to…

- Make an attack miss its mark – it strikes someone other than the intended target, or a wall, or the ground.
- Make someone lose their footing or drop their weapon.
- Make someone miss noticing something important (your call).
- Impress, dismay, or frighten someone.

You cannot use this move if you have unspent hold from this move.

**Psychometry:**  
When you handle or examine something interesting, roll+Intuition. On a hit, you can ask the GM questions. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7-9, ask 1:

- Who handled this last before me?
- Who made this?
- What strong emotions are recently associated with this?
- What has been done most recently to this, or using this?
- What’s wrong with this, and how can I fix it?

On a miss, you roll the **_trauma move_**.
