# Battle Moves

All characters have access to all Battle Moves when “in battle.”

- **_[Defend a Secure Position](#defend-a-secure-position)_**
- **_[Provide Covering Fire](#provide-covering-fire)_**
- **_[Maintain an Untenable Position or Course](#maintain-an-untenable-position-or-course)_**
- **_[Hit the Deck](#hit-the-deck)_**
- **_[Follow Through on Someone Elses Move](#follow-through-on-someone-elses-move)_**

## Defend a Secure Position
When you **_defend a secure position_** roll+Cognition. On a 10+, hold 3, on a 7-9, hold 1. As long as you defend that position, you may spend your hold, 1 for 1, to:

- Grant someone in your position 2-cover (ablative damage-track levels).
- Grant yourself 2-cover.
- Suppress an assault against your position, the enemy must stop their advance for one round.

On a miss, your position is no longer secure – it’s now untenable, and you proceed accordingly.

## Provide Covering Fire
When you **_provide covering fire for someone_**, roll+Intuition. On a hit, you keep them from coming under fire for that round of combat. On a 7-9, their position or course is untenable, and they proceed accordingly. On a miss, they suffer concentrated fire now.

## Maintain an Untenable Position or Course  
When you **_maintain an untenable course or position_**, roll+Somatics. On a hit you can hold it, and you’ll come under only incidental fire. On a 7-9, things are still untenable or insecure, you’re `glitched` until you’re safe. On a miss, you have to abandon your position now or suffer concentrated fire.

## Hit the Deck
When you **_hit the deck to avoid enemy fire_**, roll+Coordination. On 10+, you are safe. On 7-9, you get to cover, but the GM chooses 1:

- You’re pinned down (you are `glitched` until you relocate or the incoming fire stops)
- You dropped/lost something essential
- You take a glancing blow. Mark 1 damage.

Note: Any hit on this move will permit a free reload of any weapon with the `+reload` tag.

## Follow Through on Someone Else’s Move
When you **_follow through on someone else’s move_**, roll+Intuition. On a 10+, choose one of the following, as appropriate to the narrative:

- Your ally inflicts +1-damage.
- Your ally dominates someone’s position.
- You make your ally’s untenable course or position secure.
- You create an opportunity that your ally can follow through on to full effect.

On a 7-9, you create an opportunity for your ally, but they haven’t seized it or followed through on it yet. The GM will tell you what it is. On a miss, the GM chooses one of the above for an appropriate NPC instead.
