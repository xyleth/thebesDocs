## Morph

Your Morph is the body that your [Ego](/content/charactercreation/ego) is inhabiting at any given time. It could be the physical body you were born with, or perhaps a robotic shell you’re occupying temporarily. Your Morph determines your capabilities in the physical world, with some secondary influence over your social interactions.

Some morphs are strong. Some are fast, some are smart. Some morphs are looked down upon and grant the `+stigmatized` tag. Others are so unearthly in their beauty and perfection that you get bonuses to all social interaction. Your [Background](/content/charactercreation/background) determines which morph you may start play with.

When procuring a new morph see the resleeving rules.

Most morphs also have a number of [Tags](/content/tags). These tags are generally narrative, but some have game-mechanical application. See the list of [Tags](/content/tags) for more details.
