## Morph

Your Morph is the body that your [Ego](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/ego) is inhabiting at any given time. It could be the physical body you were born with, or perhaps a robotic shell you’re occupying temporarily. Your Morph determines your capabilities in the physical world, with some secondary influence over your social interactions.

Some morphs are strong. Some are fast, some are smart. Some morphs are looked down upon and grant the `+stigmatized` tag. Others are so unearthly in their beauty and perfection that you get bonuses to all social interaction. Your [Background](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/background) determines which morph you may start play with.

When procuring a new morph the list of available morphs may change at MC discretion based on circumstances. A [Procure]() roll must be made: on 10+ you get the Morph with its included mods plus 4 additional mods. On 7-9 you either get the Morph and as before but lose one rep/resource point permanently or get just the Morph with its basic mods. On a miss you either get the Morph with basic mods and two negative tags (One MC choice, one player choice) or you get a common morph of your choice with basic mods.

Most morphs also have a number of [Tags](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/tags). These tags are generally narrative, but some have game-mechanical application. See the list of [Tags](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/tags) for more details.
