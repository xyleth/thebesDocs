## Ego

Your Ego is who you are as a person. It has nothing to do with your [body](/content/morphs) and everything to do with your mind, memories, and personality. In game terms, your Ego is represented by six Stats:

**_Cognition_** – Your ego’s ability to find and apply information quickly.  
**_Intuition_** – Your ego’s ability to efficiently process external stimuli

**_Reflex_** – Your ego’s ability to fully integrate with your morph for fine motor skills  
**_Hard_** – Your ego’s ability to control your morph for physical optimization, strength, and hardiness

**_Savvy_** – Your personality’s ability to smoothly interact with others  
**_Willpower_** – Your ego’s stability, resistance to degradation over time

Your six Ego stats are generated using the following point-buy method:

- You have 5 points to spend.
- All stats begin at +0.
- A stat of +1 costs 1 point
- a stat of +2 costs 3 points
- a stat of +3 costs 6 points
- A stat of -1 gives you 1 extra point
- a stat of -2 gives you 3 extra points.
