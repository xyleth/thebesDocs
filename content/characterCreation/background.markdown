Your Background determines a number of things about your character. Are they in their original body? Were they infomorph refugees from fallen Earth? Are they poor? Rich?

Select your Background from the list below. Your background gives you a free move, details your starting [morph](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/morph) options, as well as your starting Background stats.

The many complicated, and often-competing economies of transhumanity all rely on one of two types of wealth which are represented by two stats:

**_Rep_** – Your personality’s aggregate reputation among all social media  
**_Resources_** – Your access to credits and other physical assets

These stats start at 0 unless otherwise indicated below. For more information on Rep and Resources, see [Basic Moves](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/basic-moves) and [Gear](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/gear).

**Choose 1:**

**_Drifter_**  
You were raised with a social grouping that remained on the move throughout the Sol system. This could have been free traders, pirates, asteroid farmers, scavengers, or just migrant workers. You are used to roaming space travel between habitats and stations.  
**_Starting Morph:_** Any except Futura  
**_Move:_** Any **_Logistics Move_**  
**_Background Stats:_** Either Rep or Resources at +1.

**_Fall Evacuee_**  
You were born and raised on Earth and evacuated during the horrors of the Fall, leaving your old life (and possibly your friends, family, and loved ones) behind you. You were lucky enough to survive with your body intact and continue to make a life for yourself out in the system.  
**_Starting Morph:_** Flat, Splicer  
**_Move:_** Any **_Personal Move_**  
**_Background Stats:_** Either Rep or Resources at -1.

**_Hyperelite_**  
You are privileged to have been raised as part of the immortal upper class that rules many inner system habitats and hypercorps. You were pampered with wealth and influence that most people can only dream of.  
**_Starting Morph:_** Any except Flat, Splicer, Futura, Pod, Uplift, or any Synthmorph.  
**_Move:_** [Wealth](https://eclipse-phase-apocalypse.obsidianportal.com/wikis/moves#Wealth) or [Life of the Party](https://eclipse-phase-apocalypse.obsidianportal.com/wikis/moves#Party)  
**_Background Stats:_** Resources at +2

**_Indenture_**  
You may have handed yourself over to the hypercorps before the Fall, going off-world to escape a life of violence and misery on Earth, or you may have escaped the horrors of the Fall as an infugee. Either way, you left Earth with nothing, and you spent years selling your time and labor as an indenture. Now you’ve earned your freedom and are taking your first cautious steps back into transhuman society as your own person. You might only have a dim understanding of current events and culture—your activities and news sources were heavily restricted during your indenture—but your work has helped you sharpen some skills and come away with a decent understanding of new corporate culture.  
**_Starting Morph:_** Any except Futura  
**_Move:_** Any **_Personal Move_**  
**_Background Stats:_** Both at 0

**_Infolife_**  
You entered existence as a digital consciousness—an artificial general intelligence (AGI). Your very existence is illegal in certain habitats (a legacy of those who place the Fall at the feet of rampant AIs). Unlike the seed AIs responsible for their Fall, your capacity for self-improvement is limited, though you do have full autonomy.  
**_Restrictions:_** `+stigmatized`, may never be `+psi`  
**_Starting Morph:_** Infomorph, any synthetic morph  
**_Move:_** Any **_Tech Move_**  
**_Background Stats:_** Both Rep and Resources at -1

**_Isolate_**  
You were raised as part of a self-exiled grouping on the fringes of the system. Whether raised as part of a religious group, cult, social experiment, anti-tech cell, or a group that just wanted to be isolated, you spent most if not all of your upbringing isolated from other factions.  
**_Starting Morph:_** Any except Futura  
**_Move:_** Any **_Personal Move_**  
**_Background Stats:_** Rep at -2

**_Lost_**  
You are a legacy of one of the most infamous debacles since the Fall. As a member of the “Lost generation,” you went through an accelerated-growth childhood, somehow surviving where others of your kind died, went insane, or were persecuted. Your background is a social stigma, but it does provide you with certain advantages … and burdens.  
**_Extras:_** `+stigmatized`  
**_Starting Morph:_** Futura  
**_Move:_** [Watts-MacLeod Infection](https://eclipse-phase-apocalypse.obsidianportal.com/wikis/moves#Watts)  
**_Background Stats:_** Rep at -1

**_Lunar Colonist:_**  
You experienced your childhood in one of the cramped dome cities or underground stations on Luna, Earth’s moon. You had a ringside seat to the Fall of Earth.  
**_Starting Morph:_** Flat, Splicer, Lunar-Flier  
**_Move:_** Any **_Social Move_**  
**_Background Stats:_** Resources at +1

**_Martian_**  
You were raised in a station on or above Mars, now the most populated planet in the system. Your home town may or may not have survived the Fall.  
**_Starting Morph:_** Flat, Splicer, Ruster, Martian Alpiner  
**_Move:_** Any **_Logistics Move_**  
**_Background Stats:_** Resources at +1

**_Original Space Colonist_**  
You or your parents were part of the first “generations” of colonists/workers sent out from Earth to stake a claim in space, so you are familiar with the cramped confines of spaceflight and life aboard older stations and habitats. As a “zero-one g” (zero-gravity, firstgen), you were never part of the elite. People from your background typically have some sort of specialized tech training as vacworkers or habtechs.  
**_Starting Morph:_** any EXCEPT Futura.  
**_Move:_** Any **_Tech Move_**  
**_Background Stats:_** Rep at +1

**_Re-Instantiated_**  
You were born and raised on Earth, but you did not survive the Fall. All that you know is that your body died there, but your backup was transmitted offworld, and you were one of the lucky few to be re-instantiated with a new morph. You may have spent years in dead storage, simulspace, or as an infomorph slave.  
**_Restrictions:_** Start one check down on the **_sanity track_**  
**_Starting Morph:_** Case, Infomorph, Synth  
**_Move:_** Any **_Personal Move_**  
**_Background Stats:_** Resources at -1

**_Scumborn_**  
You were raised in the nomadic and chaotic lifestyle common to scum barges.  
**_Starting Morph:_** Splicer, Bouncer, Pods, Synth  
**_Move:_** Any **_Social Move_**  
**_Background Stats:_** Rep at +1

**_Uplift_**  
You are not even human. You were born as an uplifted animal: chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, parrot, pig, raven, crow, or octopus.  
**_Starting Morph:_** (choose one) Neo-Avian, Neo-Hominid, Neo-Pig, Octomorph  
**_Move:_** Any **_Personal Move_**  
**_Background Stats:_** Both at 0
