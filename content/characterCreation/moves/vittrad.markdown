## Vittrad Moves

These moves may only be taken by a character with the `+vittrad` tag.

**_The Black Signal_**  
On some level beyond conventional space/time you are one with everyone else infected by the Vittrad strain, or anyone they’ve consumed. When you need some knowledge or expertise you don’t have and you **_tap into the the Black Signal_** roll+Willpower. on a 10+, you get the knowledge or expertise you require. On a 7-9 you get something close but not exactly what you need. If you have the move **_Consuming the Stack_** you can instead use the black signal to look in on anyone you’ve consumed. On a 10+, you see them, clear as day. On a 7-9 the view is hazy and indistinct.

**_Consuming the Stack_**  
When you **_consume the cortical stack of another_** they’re a part of you forever, any iteration, any backup, any fork. At any time, over any distance, you can try to compel them to follow your bidding. Roll+Willpower. On a 10+, they choose 1:

- They do what you want, maybe knowing it was you, maybe justifying it themselves.
- They resist and suffer the consequences  
  On a 7-9, they choose 1:
- half-heartedly do something close, justifying their actions
- become crippled with indecision and inaction
- hear the voices in their head and act erraticly

Consuming a cortical stack can be done through ascension-splicing, or consuming their ego in a `+virtual` environment using **_Glitch in the System_** or if you’re in a biomorph you can physically swallow it by **_taking a chance_** using Somatics.

**_Cutting the Lies_**  
When you take time and physical intimacy with someone, and you cut away the skin that hides their lies, roll+Willpower. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. While you’re cutting their flesh, spend your hold to ask them questions, 1 for 1:

- For what are you most ashamed?
- What lie do you tell even to yourself?
- What would cause you to despair?
- What/Who do you hate more than anything?
- What punishment do you most deserve and fear?

This move can only be used if you are sleeved in a biomorph, and only works on subjects sleeved in biomorphs.

**_Glitch in the System_**  
You can see the tiny flaws in any virtual system. You always know if you have the `+virtual` tag, and you always know if you’re in a simulspace or some other virtual reality. While `+virtual` you can **_glitch the system_**. Roll+Willpower. On a hit, you can change one aspect of the reality around you. On a 10+, you gain partial administrator access permitting follow-up, minor changes.

**_Opening the Gates_**  
When confronted by a barrier intended to keep people out, either physical security or virtual defenses, roll+Intuition. On a hit, you see the flaws and comprehend any opportunities. On a 10+, you unravel it, opening the way.
