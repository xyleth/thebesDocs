**_Command_**  
When you **_lead a gang into battle_**, roll+Savvy. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. Over the course of the fight, spend your hold 1 for 1 to make your gang:

- Make a hard advance
- Stand strong against a hard advance
- Make an organized retreat
- Show mercy to their defeated enemies
- Fight and die to the last

On a miss, your orders get misunderstood or garbled or otherwise confused.

If you don’t already have a gang, this move GIVES you one (see [NPCs, Gangs, and Vehicles](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/npcs-gangs-and-vehicles)). If you do already have a gang, you can choose a new option for your gang instead.

**_Contact Network_**  
You have developed an extensive network of allies and contacts who can provide help or resources in a pinch. When you take this move, choose one:

- Your contacts respect your reputation. Roll+Rep when contacting them.
- Your contacts respect your allure or forceful personality. Roll+Savvy when contacting them.
- Your contacts respect intelligence. Roll+Cognition when contacting them.

At the beginning of the session, or as soon thereafter as you are in a position to do so, you may **_contact your network_** and roll the appropriate stat. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. You may spend your hold anytime during that session, 1 for 1, to:

- Get something done: find one or more contacts to accomplish an off-screen task
- Lean on someone: convince a character as if you’d rolled a 10+ on **_negotiate_**
- Gather intel: learn something about a subject as if you’d rolled a 10+ on **_access the mesh_**
- Borrow Resources: gain temporary access to an item, morph, piece of equipment, or service

On a miss, your network needs a favor in return. Lose access to this move until you satisfy them.

**_Fork Synergy_**  
You have embraced the stigmatized practice of forking your ego, and regularly have multiple copes of yourself active at any given time. You can accomplish so much more this way, and so long as you regularly integrate them back into yourself, side-effects are kept at a minimum. You never roll the **_trauma move_** to reintegrate a fork (unless a truly excessive period of time has passed). At the end of every game session, mark experience.

**_Mercenaries_**  
You have a mercenary force who obeys you only as long as you can pay. When you **_try to impose your will on your gang_**, roll+Resources. On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7-9, choose 2. On a miss, choose 1 anyway:

- They do what you want.
- They don’t overcharge you, and you don’t lose 1-Resources permanently.
- Their Vulnerability doesn’t activate, or you don’t have to hurt one of them.

If you don’t already have a gang, this move gives you one (see [NPCs, Gangs, and Vehicles](https://htmltomd.com/wikis/npcs-gangs-and-vehicles)). If you already have a gang, select one more option for them.

**_Tactical Acumen_**  
You look at every situation with a tactical eye, and are commonly prepared for most surprises. When you **_declare retroactively that you’ve already set something up_**, roll+Cognition. On a 10+ it’s just as you say. On a 7-9, you set it up but here at the crucial moment the GM can introduce some hitch or delay. On a miss, you set it up, but since then things you don’t know about have seriously changed.

**_Wealth_**  
You have developed extensive investments and agents whose job it is to keep you in credits. At the beginning of the session, roll+Cognition or +Savvy (your choice) to see how your fortune is faring. On a 10+, you have surplus on hand for your needs. On a 7-9, you have surplus, but choose one want. On a miss, your investments are in want. The GM will choose one or more. The precise values of your surplus and want are determined by creating your investments below.

Choose 2 Benefits:

- Your investments are extensive, but thinly spread. Payout: 1-hold, want: needy
- Your investments are compact and well administered. Remove one want.
- Your investments profit from violent conflict. Payout: 1-hold, want: embattled
- You’ve invested in the information trade. Payout: `+boosted` on one roll to **_access the mesh_** or **_assess the situation_**, want: infiltrated
- You’ve invested in physical resources, perhaps a planet rich in minerals or a refinery. Payout: 1-hold, want: immobile
- You’re a minor shareholder in another, larger organization. Payout: 1-hold, want: obligation
- Your people have access to rare or specialized technology. Payout: 1-hold, want: idle

Then Choose 1 Weakness:

- Your investments are always working for you, or deeply concealed. Want: unreliable
- Your investments are micromanaged and rely entirely on you for everything. Want: desperation
- Your investments are subject to bullying or blackmail. Want: reprisals
- Your investments are in large companies with multiple masters. Want: obligation

You may spend Payout hold, 1 for 1, to gain +1forward on any roll to **_procure something_**. Alternately, you may spend 3-hold to increase your Resources stat by 1.

For advancement, choose 2 new benefits, or take 1 new benefit and remove 1 weakness.
