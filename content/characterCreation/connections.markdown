# Connections

Connections, or Cx, reflect how well you know your fellow travellers. Like most stats Cx ranges from -2 to +3. It doesn’t say how long you’ve known them, how much you like them, how positive your history together has been, or anything else necessarily, just how well you get them. The game assumes that everyone knows everyone else from the start, if you are in this game it is because you are already one of the most interesting badasses around and you have a group of fellow badasses in your orbit, and around whom you orbit.

If your Cx with somebody is negative, that means that you really don’t know them and can’t predict what they’ll do. thus, you can’t effectively help them OR screw them over.

Cx can be, and often is, asymmetrical.

To establish Cx each player picks from one of the following question sets. Each question set can be taken by only one player - in the event of a conflict that cannot be resolved amicably roll off with the higher number winning. Choose the set that you feel most closely associates with your characters persona.

Each player takes it in turn to describe the character by name, look and outlook. Then go around again with each player taking their turn to ask for volunteers to answer 1, 2 or 3 of their questions, marking Cx appropriately based on the responses. This continues until all questions have been answered and all connections have been established.
