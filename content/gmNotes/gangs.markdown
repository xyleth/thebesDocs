# Gangs

Gangs are best thought of as weapons with feelings. Mechanically they act as weapons, they have a `damage` rating that they inflict. They also have an `armour` value for incoming fire that works slightly differently to PC armour. As Gangs do not roll the `damage` move their armour instead reduces the incoming damage by its value, to a minimum of 0 (a gang will never get _better_ when it gets shot at!). Gangs are often commanded by **_Warlords_**, who operate as a separate threat.

Much like weapons gangs can have `tags` attached to them. For instance the gang might have access to railguns and so their incoming fire might have the `ap1` tag. All gangs have **_vulnreablities_** - this specifies how they fall apart when things go wrong for them. Assuming they are not wiped out in combat these can influence the size of the gang in future encounters.
