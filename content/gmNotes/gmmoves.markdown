# GM Moves

Whenever a player makes a move, the GM may make a move. Generally this will be a _soft_ move, driving the narrative or setting things up for later.

Whenever a player makes a move and fails (rolls a 6-) the player marks experience and the GM holds 1 against that character. The GM may immediately, or at any time thereafter, spend his hold, 1 for 1, to make a move against that character from his list, even a _hard_ move.

The GM’s moves are:

_Soft Moves:_

- Announce off-screen badness.
- Announce future badness.
- Make them buy.
- Tell them the possible consequences and ask.
- Offer an opportunity, with or without a cost.
- Put someone in a spot.
- Trade harm for harm.

_Hard Moves:_

- Separate them.
- Capture someone.
- Inflict harm.
- Take away their stuff.
- Activate their stuff’s downside.
- Turn their move back on them.
- Make a threat move.

_Battle Moves:_

- [Inflict concentrated fire](/content/rules/combat.html#concentrated-fire)
