# Resleeving

Resleeving is the act of changing your morph. It can be voluntary, like swapping outfits before going to dinner. It can be involuntary, if your current morph has suffered critical damage. But in all cases the general process is the same, follow these steps in order.

## Determine Ego source

First you need to know where the Ego to inhabit the new Morph is coming from. If this is a voluntary resleeve under normal conditions then this will often be your current Ego, transferred from your existing morph. For Egos moving to or from a biomorph this requires the use of an Ego Bridge and takes approximately one hour to make the switch. Egos running on Cyberbrains or as Infomorphs can move in a matter of seconds given the bandwidth available in 10AF.

Egos can also be sourced from forks, that is a fully instantiated copy of your current running Ego. If you have a functioning `cortical stack` then a fork may be created from that in seconds, otherwise a trip to the ego bridge is in order. Installing a fork into a morph follows the same rules as above regarding time.

Involuntary resleeving is more complicated. If your morph is destroyed but the stack is intact then your ego may be recovered from the stack with memory intact up to the point of death. If the stack is destroyed then you can be recovered from backup, assuming you have one, albeit with a varying degree of Lack. No stack and no backup? Then you are truly dead.

If a resleeve is forced in this way you are `glitched` on the subsequent Trauma Move for [Integration and Continuity](/content/moves/basicmoves.html#integration-and-continuity)

## Obtaining a morph

When procuring a new morph the list of available morphs may change at MC discretion based on circumstances. A [Procure]() roll must be made:

- on 10+ you get the Morph with its included mods plus 4 items of gear
- On 7-9 you _either_ get the Morph and as before but lose one rep/resource point permanently, or get just the Morph
- On a miss you either get the Morph and two negative tags (One MC choice, one player choice) or you get a morph chosen at random from the following table.

| 2d6+Savvy roll | Morph                                                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2-             | [Spare](/content/morphs/synthetics.html#spare)                       |
| 3              | [Case](/content/morphs/synthetics.html#case)                         |
| 4              | [Synth](/content/morphs/synthetics.html#synth)                       |
| 5              | [Critter](/content/morphs/pods.html#critters)                        |
| 6              | [Basic Pod](/content/morphs/pods.html#basic-pods)                    |
| 7              | [Splicer](/content/morphs/biomorphs.html#splicers)                   |
| 8              | [Hibernoid](/content/morphs/biomorphs.html#hibernoids)               |
| 9              | [Neo-Pig](/content/morphs/biomorphs.html#neo-pig)                    |
| 10             | [Infomorph & Ghost rider](/content/morphs/infomorphs.html#infomorph) |
| 11             | [Steel morph](/content/morphs/synthetics.html#steel-morph)           |
| 12+            | [Olympian](/content/morphs/biomorphs.html#olympians)                 |

Next make the 'Pimp my ride' move:

### Pimp my ride

Roll +Resources/Rep (your choice). On a 10+ get 6 items of non-restricted gear. On 7-9 get 4. On 6- get 2.

You may only make this move once per resleeve.

## Integration and continuity

Finally you must take the [Integration and continuity](/content/moves/basicmoves.html#integration-and-continuity) move
