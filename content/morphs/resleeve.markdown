When procuring a new morph the list of available morphs may change at MC discretion based on circumstances. A [Procure]() roll must be made: on 10+ you get the Morph with its included mods plus 4 items of gear. On 7-9 you either get the Morph and as before but lose one rep/resource point permanently or get just the Morph. On a miss you either get the Morph and two negative tags (One MC choice, one player choice) or you get a common morph of your choice.

Next make the 'Pimp my ride' move:

**Pimp my ride**
Roll +Resources/Rep (your choice). On a 10+ get 6 items of gear. On 7-9 get 4. On 6- get 2.

Finally you must make an [Integration check]()
