# Pods

For game-mechanical purposes, Pods are considered Biomorphs.

Pods (from “pod people”) are vat-grown, biological bodies with extremely undeveloped brains that are augmented with an implanted computer and cybernetics system. Though typically run by an AI, pods are socially unfavored in some stations, used as slave labor in others, and even illegal in some areas. Because pods underwent accelerated growth in their creation and were mostly grown as separate parts and then assembled, their biological design includes some shortcuts and limitations, offset with implants and regular maintenance. They lack reproductive capabilities. In many habitats, their legal status is a hotly contested issue.

## Augur Pod

Augurs were designed to incorporate biological androids into teaching, instruction, lab work, and administrative positions. They are now offered as cheaper alternatives to mentons.

## Basic Pods:

When pods were first introduced, non-specialized models were favored due to their low cost and quicker production time. Basic pods are essentially a lower cost pod version of a splicer morph. To keep expenses down, this pod has slightly more mechanical parts than most other pods. As a result, it has more obvious cybernetic components.

## Critters:

Critters are pods either genetically hacked together from various animal species or simply biosculpted to appear as such. Originally popular among hyperelites who preferred smarter and distinctive AI-operated pets, they were also sometimes deployed on a covert basis as bodyguards or spies disguised as smart animals. Naturally these morphs were also embraced by people with a furry kink or who simply wanted to test-drive a body that was more bestial. Critter pods come in almost every conceivable type of animal shape, from cats to skunks to chimerical lizard-hyena hybrids. The vast majority are quadruped and stick close to the animal type’s body plan, though anthropomorphic models are also popular and there is a great deal of bodysculpted variety. A model currently popular in the inner system is the bastet, a composite of several wild cat species that resembles a tawny panther or lion, often with intricate patterns based on Egyptian hieroglyphs in their fur.

## Pleasure Pods:

Pleasure pods are exactly what they seem—faux humans designed purely for intimate entertainment purposes. Pleasure pods have extra nerve clusters in their erogenous zones, fine motor control over certain muscle groups, enhanced pheromones, sanitized metabolisms, and the genetics for purring. Naturally, they are crafted for good looks and charisma and enhanced in other areas as well. Pleasure pods are capable of switching their sex at will to male, female, hermaphrodite, neuter, or other intersex variations.

## Security Pods:

Originally developed for joint-nation peace-keeping missions and border/enclave security roles, security pods were essentially mass-produced AI-operated soldiers. For obvious reasons, they fell out of favor during the Fall, but they are slowly regaining acceptance. They are a favored morph by mercenaries for inﬁltration and guerrilla warfare purposes.

## Traceur:

These athletic pods were first designed pre-Fall to incorporate androids into sports with biological humans. Now they are mass
produced as an alternative to olympian morphs.

## Novacrab:

Novacrabs are a pod design bioengineered from coconut crab and spider crab stock and grown to a larger (human) size. Novacrabs are ideal for hazardous work environments as well as vacworker, police, or bodyguard duties, given their ten 2-meter long legs, massive claws, and chitinous armor. They climb and handle microgravity well and can withstand a wide range of atmospheric pressure (and sudden pressure changes) from vacuum to deep sea. Novacrabs feature compound eyes (with human-equivalent image resolution), gills, dexterous manipulatory digits on their fifth set of limbs, and transgenic vocal cords.

## Vacuum Pods:

Optimized for vacwork, this pod is preferred in situations where novacrabs or synths don’t fare as well socially. The vacuum pod is based on the bouncer morph and looks superﬁcially identical to one.

## Worker Pods:

Part exalt human, part machine, these basic pods are virtually indistinguishable from humans. Worker pods are often used in menial labor jobs where interaction with humans is necessary.
