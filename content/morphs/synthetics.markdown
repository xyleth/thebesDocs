# Synthetic Morphs

Synthetic morphs are completely artificial/robotic. They are usually operated by AIs or via remote control, but the lack of available biomorphs after the Fall meant that many infugees resorted to resleeving in robotic shells, which were also cheaper, quicker to manufacture, and more widely available. Nevertheless, synthmorphs are viewed with disdain in many habitats, an option that only the poor and desperate accept to be sleeved in. Synthetic morphs are not without their advantages, however, and so are commonly used for menial labor, heavy labor, habitat construction, and security services.

All synthmorphs have the following advantages:

- Lack of Biological Functions. Synthmorphs need not be bothered with trivialities like breathing, eating, defecating, aging, sleeping, or any similar minor but crucial aspects of biological life.
- Pain Filter. Synthmorphs can filter out their pain receptors so that they are unhampered by wounds or physical damage. This allows them to ignore any **_damage tags_** but they are `+glitched` on any tactile-based rolls and will sometimes not even notice they have been damaged.
- Environmental Durability. Synthmorphs are built to withstand a wide range of environments, from dusty Mars to the oceans of Europa to the vacuum of space. They are unaffected by any but the most extreme temperatures and atmospheric pressures. `+temperature tolerance` and `+vacuum sealing`.
- Toughness. Synthetic shells are made to last—a fact reflected in their built in Armor ratings.

## Case:

Cases are extremely cheap, mass-produced robotic shells intended to provide an affordable remorphing option for the millions of infugees created by the Fall. Though many varieties of case shells exist, they are uniformly regarded as shoddy and inferior. Most case morphs are vaguely anthropomorphic, with a thin framework body standing just shorter than an average human. They suffer from frequent malfunctions.

## Synth:

Synths are anthropomorphic robotic shells (androids and gynoids). They are typically used for menial labor jobs where pods are not as good of an option. Cheaper than many other morphs, they are commonly used for people who need a body quickly and cheaply or simply on a transient basis. Though they look humanoid, synths are easily recognizable as non-biological unless they have `+synthetic mask`.

## Arachnoids:

Arachnoid robotic shells are 1-meter in length, segmented into two parts, with a smaller head like a spider or termite. They feature four pairs of 1.5-meterlong retractable arms/legs, capable of rotating around the axis of the body, with built-in pneumatic systems for propelling the bot with small leaps. The manipulator claws on each arm/leg can be switched out with extendable mini-wheels for high-speed skating movement. A smaller pair of manipulator arms near the head allows for closer handling and tool use. In zero-g environments, arachnoids can retract their arms/legs and maneuver with vectored air thrusters.

## Dragonfly:

The dragonfly robotic morph takes the shape of a meter-long flexible shell with multiple wings and manipulator arms. Capable of near-silent turbofanaided flight in Earth gravity, dragonfly bots fare even better in microgravity.

## Flexbots:

Designed for multipurpose functions, flexbots can transform their shells to suit a range of situations and tasks. Their core frame consists of a half-dozen interlocking and shape-adjustable modules capable of auto-transforming into a variety of shapes: multilegged walker, tentacle, hovercraft, and many others. Each module features its own sensor units and “bush robot” fractal-branching digits (capable of breaking into smaller digits, down to the micrometer scale, allowing for ultra-fine manipulation). The flexbot control computer is also distributed between modules. Individual flexbots are only the size of a large dog, but multiple flexbots can join together for larger mass operations, even taking on heavy-duty tasks such as demolition, excavation, manufacturing, robotics assembly, and so on.

## Guard:

Everyone knows that synthmorphs are tougher and better equipped for serious combat than biomorphs. However, many people in the inner system are not comfortable with using hulking synthmorphs as bodyguards or security personnel. Instead, some choose this subtle and extremely deadly alternative. This morph’s enhanced senses allow it to more easily detect any threats to the person the user is guarding, and the built-in weaponry and moderate armor make it highly resistant to damage. The synthetic mask disguises it quite effectively as an olympian or fury morph.

## Reaper:

The reaper is a common combat bot, used in place of biomorph soldiers and typically operated via teleoperation or by autonomous AI. The reaper’s core form is an armored disc, so that it can turn and present a thin profile to an enemy. It uses vector-thrust nozzles to maneuver in microgravity and also takes advantage of an ionic drive for fast movement over distance. Four legs/manipulating arms and four weapon pods are folded inside its frame. The reaper’s shell is made of smart materials, allowing these limbs and weapon mounts to extrude in any direction desired and even to change shape and length. In gravity environments, the reaper walks or hops on two or four of these limbs. Reapers are infamous due to numerous war XPs, and bringing one into most habitats will undoubtedly raise eyebrows if not get you arrested.

## Slitheroids:

Slitheroid bots are synthetic shells taking the form of a 2-meter-long segmented metallic snake, with two retractable arms for tool use. Snake bots can coil, twist, and roll their bodies into a ball or hoop, moving either by slithering, burrowing, rolling, or pulling themselves along by their arms. The sensor suite and control computer are housed in the head.

## Spare:

Spare morphs are small, cheap, lightweight, synthetic shells designed to be used as a replacement should someone’s original morph be killed or destroyed. A cortical stack (retrieved from the character’s previous morph) can be easily plugged into the spare morph, effectively resleeving them (they must make Integration, Alienation, and Continuity Tests as normal). Once plugged in, it takes only a few moments for the cortical stack’s data to be read and checked for integrity and the ego to run inside the spare’s cyberbrain. Spares are designed for portability. Packed as a flat disc 15 centimeters in diameter and with a mass of 2 kilograms, when activated they pop into a spherical shape with 6 slender and retractable 20-centimeter limbs (3 arms and 3 legs). They are a common piece of equipment for gatecrashing teams.

## Sphere:

Popular with AGIs and synthmorph activists, this morph is a sphere approximately one meter in diameter. It can extend up to four ﬂexible limbs as required, and typically hovers at approximately human eye level. The ﬁrst tests of this morph revealed that the chameleon surface was necessary because it allows the user to display the image of a face, which made most transhumans both more comfortable talking with this morph and less likely to assume that it is a robot.

## Steel Morph:

This morph was developed by technicians and designers who are members of the Lunar synthmorph rights movement, the Steel Liberators. Middle-class Lunars who came out of poverty and continue to actively support the Steel Liberators sometimes choose this morph, despite the fact that this choice often results in them experiencing significant prejudice from biochauvinists. There is a variant that possesses `+synthetic mask` but it’s rarer, as most who use this morph want to make a point.

## Swarmanoid:

The swarmanoid is not a single shell per se, but rather a swarm of hundreds of insect-sized robotic microdrones. Each individual “bug” is capable of crawling, rolling, hopping several meters, or using nanocopter fan blades for airlift. The controlling computer, cortical stack, and sensor systems are distributed throughout the swarm. Though the swarm can “meld” together into a roughly child-sized shape, the swarm is incapable of tackling physical tasks like grabbing, lifting, or holding as a unit. Individual bugs are quite capable of interfacing with electronics.
