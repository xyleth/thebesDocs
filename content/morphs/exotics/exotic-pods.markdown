# Exotic Pods

**Ayah:**  
Despite the advances in biotechnology, the hyperelite still need caretakers for their children and inﬁrm. The ayah pod morph is designed to fulfill all nurse and caretaker functions. Rather than trust lower-class transhumans, hyperelites prefer AGI servants sleeved into ayah morphs, especially in polities where AGIs have few, if any, legal rights. Ayahs are almost always female with pleasant but not stunningly beautiful features. Most of the enhanced features of an ayah are built under the hood, so to speak. Their enhanced olfactory capabilities help them monitor the health and emotional state of their wards, as well as alert them to potential environmental dangers. Their ability to withstand temperature extremes and survive without air for short periods helps them protect and rescue their charges in an emergency, such as a hull breach or a ﬁre. Ayahs are often modified with bioweave armor and implanted weapons so they can act as a last line of defense against potential attackers.

**Chickcharnie:**  
Another creation by the mad geniuses of the exoplanet Fortean, this morph is a modified version of a resurrected species. The extinct Tyto pollens was a large pre-Columbian flightless ground owl species in the Caribbean. The chickcharnie was rumored to be a supernatural variant of this bird that haunted the forests bestowing boons or curses upon travelers depending on how they treated it. The Fortean version of the chickcharnie is best described as a humanoid owl. Over one meter in height, it is bipedal but stands shorter than humans. Though winged, it is flightless except in very low grav environments and microgravity. Its wing design, however, incorporates a functional set of clawed hands. The chickcharnie is growing in popularity among neo-avians who don’t mind sacrificing flight for physical resilience, more functional hands, and a stature closely approximating transhuman standards.

**Diggers:**  
Diggers are worker pods customized for archaeological work. They are used for surface surveys, excavation, and general physical labor by xenoarchaeological teams. Their hands are modified digging claws, adapted from the genetics of hole-digging creatures like moles and aardvarks, though still flexible and useful for grasping and fine manipulation.

**Flying Squid:**  
Given the popularity of octomorphs even among nonmercurials, morph designers have sought out a similar morph that is operable in zero g and also designed for speed. Its streamlined form resembles a stylized squid and this morph can move swiftly in both water and air. It can suck either water or air into a cavity in its mantle and then expel it out a siphon in a chosen direction for fast, jet-like propulsion. While popular with neo-octopi, its speed and overall utility has made it an increasingly favorite option with others seeking an aquatic-adapted morph.

**Hypergibbon:** (Pod Biomorph)  
Built from siamang genestock, the largest of the lesser apes, hypergibbons are often mistaken for uplifts, although this is not the case. The gibbon was never a candidate for uplift due to a brain anatomy considerably more primitive than great apes. With the addition of a cyberbrain, though, they make excellent pods. Many primate uplifts choose hypergibbons in place of other pods or when they need something small like a neotenic. Hypergibbons stand about 1 meter tall, weigh 15 kilograms, and typically have black fur and skin (although bodysculpting permits many variations). They have inflatable throat sacks that allow melodious calls that carry great distances. Their wrists feature a ball-and-socket joint and also naturally dislocate to enable easier swinging by the arms.

**Jenkin:**  
The handiwork of scum genehacker Neville Orsonglass, the jenkin is a byproduct of desperate measures taken during the Fall. The original model was simply the designer’s attempt to keep him and his crewmates alive on a ship with failing life support and recycling systems. From there, it has evolved into the ultimate survivor’s morph, though the definition of “survivor” has now been extended to “can take all of the drugs and still function sexually.” This seems to be a selling point with the scum. Despite the morph’s stooped posture, rat-like features, and pungent personal aroma, the implausibly sized secondary sexual characteristics make it the life of certain kinds of parties.

**Ripwing:**  
Developed by the genehackers of Fortean, ripwings are neogenetic avians, incorporating genetics from a range of flying creatures, some of them prehistoric pterosaur genes acquired from Sky Ark researchers, along with some original genetic traits. These transgenic amalgamations are larger and sturdier than standard neo-avian morphs. They are popular among both neo-avian mercurials who want a more robust form and gatecrashers looking for a quick and stealthy flyer for recon missions. The ripwing morph makes more extensive use of the chiroptera genestocks used to give the first avian uplifts functional hands. Instead of feathers, ripwings feature tough leathery skin or even scales. The morphs are usually a uniform matte black in color, though they are able to change color at will due to their chameleon skin enhancements.

**Samsa:**  
The samsa was the ﬁrst attempt to create a combat pod model with a terrifying appearance. The samsa is an intimidating, two-meter-tall, four-armed, four-legged, humanoid insect. Samsas are an unsettling sight to many transhumans. They are most commonly used by mercenaries and enforcers in the rim. Their armored carapace provides protection and the extra limbs allow a character to dual wield rifles or other two-handed weapons.

**Shaper:** (Pod biomorph)  
Shapers are the ultimate disguise morph. Constructed as pods, the default shaper look is intentionally generic, based on the computer-generated composite average look of the solar system’s residents. They lack the distinctive seam lines applied to most pod morph designs. The skinflex system allows the morph to quickly change its outward appearance. Additional modifications help the morph evade or fool sensor and biometric systems. Shapers are a favorite tool for spies and are excellent for infiltration or fooling surveillance. They are often remotely operated via puppet sock. Shapers are illegal in many habitats.
