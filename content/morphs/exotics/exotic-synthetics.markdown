# Exotic Synthetic Morphs

**Biocore:**  
Originally designed by a scum engineer who just wanted to see if it could be done, the biocore is a synthmorph with a biological brain. The design has since spread to those who wish to enjoy the advantages of sleeving in a synthmorph without the risk of brainhacking or who simply dislike the idea of using a cyberbrain (including some asyncs). Most models feature a stylized but transparent braincase, to show off the biocore’s main feature, but others appear to be ordinary synthmorphs from the outside; only a detailed physical examination can determine that it actually contains a living brain.

**_Tags:_** `+access jack`, `+mesh inserts`, `+brain box`, `+cortical stack`, `+eidetic memory`

**Blackbird:**  
When they’re seen at all, these morphs resemble a matte gray neo-corvid with many odd, sharp angles. Blackbirds are consummate stealth morphs, designed to evade visual observation and radar during recon or infiltration. In part due to aesthetics, they’re a favorite of neo-ravens.

**Cetus:**  
The cetus, named after a mythological sea monster, was designed for deep sea activity and is capable of operating under extreme pressure and cold. It is a favored morph for use in the undersea domains of Ceres and Europa. Capable of moving quickly underwater, the morph can also operate outside of water in the atmospheric portion of habitats. Cetus morphs are slightly smaller than arachnoids.

**Cloud Skimmer:**  
This streamlined synthmorph is designed for exploring the atmospheres of gas giants, but its internal rocket also allows it to operate in vacuum. This morph can travel to and from a ship in orbit around a gas giant into the planet’s atmosphere on its own. The morph is a ﬂattened oval that can extend up to four ﬂexible arms. The swim bladder acts much like a high pressure balloon to help keep the morph aloft in a gas giant’s dense atmosphere.

**Courier:**  
This synthmorph was specifically designed to fly between the many moons and habitats in the Saturnian system. It is used by both couriers and smugglers throughout the outer system. This morph appears to be a roughly humanoid head and torso set on a conical base, with a total height of 1.5 meters, that makes it look rather like a four-armed chess piece. This base contains both the morph’s ionic propulsion system, which doubles as a plasma sail in space, and an internal rocket. This miniature metallic hydrogen rocket is specifically designed for low thrust. It provides an acceleration of up to 0.25 g, allowing the morph to take off and land on all moons and other small bodies in the solar system. This engine can operate for a total of one and a half hours before it requires refueling. The morph’s four slender arms fold flat against its torso when it is in flight. Its extensive sensor suit is useful for both navigation and various covert purposes.

**Daitya:**  
This huge, vaguely anthropomorphic synthmorph is designed for large construction projects and similar heavy industrial uses, such as moving large objects. At just under three-meters tall and with a mass of almost one ton, the daitya is essentially an industrial mech. Modified versions have occasionally been deployed for combat purposes.

**Fenrir:**  
Named for the monstrous wolf of Norse legend, the fenrir is one of the most imposing combat morphs ever developed. It is found only in the armed forces of the Hyoden city-state on Callisto (though blackmarket blueprints/copies are rumored to be available elsewhere). A massive, squat quadrupedal morph designed to be operated by up to six egos simultaneously, the fenrir is more akin to a super-heavy tank than a regular morph. It is possible that a single ego could fill all six ego slots at once through the use of alpha forks, but this has never been tested. The most common weapons mounted are linked HEAP and/or plasmaburst seeker launchers, exoatmospheric plasma beam bolters, and machine railguns loaded with AP rounds.

**Fighting Kite:**  
Based on the kite morph popular with gatecrashers, this morph is somewhat more durable and better armored. It also includes a built-in laser as well as anti-detection measures. Its default mode is turbofan-driven rotorcraft; its light weight allows it to ﬂy and hover, even in thin atmospheres and heavy gravities. In streamlined ionic mode, it can travel at high speeds and maneuver in hurricane-force winds. In vacuum, it can drive itself with thrust-vector nozzles. It is occasionally used for aerial reconnaissance, but is most popular with spies, thieves, and discrete bodyguards.

**_Extras:_** `+flight`

**Galatea:**  
A group of Lunar morph designers created this high-end synthmorph in an attempt to increase the social acceptance of synthmorphs by showcasing how attractive and versatile they can be. This elegant morph looks expensive and is designed to allow the user to master any social situation. A few media icons and socialites have already found that this morph’s mixture of utility and novelty value has helped enhance their fame and reputation.

**_Extras:_** You are `+boosted` on any rolls to charm or make a good first impression.

**Gargoyle:**  
Gargoyles are an anthroform synthetic morph designed as a mobile sensor unit. They are used by media, freelance journalists, forensics teams, and anyone who is regularly required to document a situation thoroughly. Though humanoid in shape, gargoyles stand taller than average transhumans for better viewing. Much of their exterior surface is covered in quantum dot camera-displays.

**_Extras:_** `+stigmatized`

**Griefer:**  
Based on the case synthmorph design, griefers are used by vandals, terrorists, and dedicated trolls to harass enemies and antagonize the masses. Griefers have embedded sound and holographic display systems so they can easily harass an individual or an entire crowd. They are also typically equipped with numerous hacking tools and software aids, though they do not come with these by default. Most importantly, they are built without cortical stacks, so if they are destroyed, the ego cannot be interrogated through psychosurgery. Griefers are illegal in many habitats, especially in the Planetary Consortium, but DRM\-free blueprints are easy to ﬁnd in many darknets, thus making them a persistent annoyance in some systems. A few habitats have passed laws mandating that killing a griefer is not considered murder, assault, or even destruction of property.

**_Extras:_** `+stigmatized`, `+lemon`, (note, this morph does not come with a cortical stack)

**Kite:**  
This small shape-shifting synthetic shell is capable of flight no matter the atmospheric environment—or lack thereof. Its default mode is turbofan-driven rotorcraft; its light weight allows it to fly and hover even in thin atmospheres and heavy gravities. In streamlined ionic mode, it can travel at high speeds and maneuver in hurricane-force winds.  
In vacuum, it can drive itself with thrust-vector nozzles. Sometimes called “multifliers,” kites are popular among gatecrashers and gatehoppers due to their adaptability and usefulness for aerial recon and surveys.

**Mimic:**  
In its basic form, with its limbs retracted, a mimic morph resembles a spare and is only a bit larger than a human head. With its four pencil-thin telescoping legs fully extended, it can stand up to two meters tall, and its arms can also each reach up to two meters from the morph. These limbs can all be fully retracted and the user can also alter the morph’s shape and appearance, causing it to look like almost any small object such as a briefcase, cleaning robot, or household appliance. This morph can easily ﬁt through small spaces and hide itself with great ease and is ideal for inﬁltration and sabotage missions.  
**_Armor:_** +1  
**_Tags:_** `+access jack`, `+cortical stack`, `+mesh inserts`, `+cyberbrain`, `+mnemonic augmentation`, `+chameleon skin`, `+enhanced vision`, `+extra limbs` (4 Legs, 2 Arms), `+grip pads`, `+puppet sock`, `+shape adjusting`, `+skinﬂex`, `+telescoping limbs`

**Nautiloid:**  
Nautiloids are a hybrid of short-range spacecraft and submersible capable of holding up to six passengers and their gear. The morph is shaped like a van-sized nautilus, with crew space in the head and shell. A cluster of tentacular limbs mounted under the observation ports in the head provide both ﬁne and brute force manipulation. Originally created for comet and asteroid mining, the design also proved useful for oceanic exploration by gatecrashing teams and Europans. The morph’s interior includes a desktop cornucopia machine and a maker. It can deploy a pair of retractable pontoons for stability when ﬂoating on a liquid surface. A nautiloid’s life support system can support its occupants for up to three months before replenishing—indefinitely if it has a source of hydrogen and oxygen. Nautiloids include radiation shielding, a small airlock, and a healing vat. The nautiloid is also available as a bot with no cyberbrain for the same cost.

**Opteryx:**  
This recon morph is designed to be a fast, lightweight runner, climber, and ﬂyer. The opteryx looks like a one-meter-tall winged, synthetic dinosaur and adopts an almost horizontal body posture when running, its tail held out for balance. Its wings are fully functional arms equipped with claws. This morph is a favorite for gatecrashers and neo-avians in the dinosaur identity subculture. It comes equipped with cartography package software.

**Q-Morph:**  
Quartz morphs, commonly called Q-morphs, are the primary shell design used for Venusian surface mining. Constructed from quartz and extremely durable alloys, Q-morphs look like four-legged crabs with two pairs of arms. The lower pair of arms is designed for strength, the upper pair for precision and dexterity. This morph is squat, exceptionally tough, and completely unable to function in temperatures below 250 C.

**Rover:**  
Rover morphs are a smaller, defense-oriented version of the sphere morph. Each rover is 0.6 meters in diameter and, with its limbs retracted, has the ominous appearance of a reﬂective, shiny, black globe. It can extrude three arms, each with a built-in weapon: extendable claws, a small laser, and a heavy rail pistol loaded with 200 rounds of ammunition. Rovers are stealthy and highly maneuverable and so favored for bodyguard and police purposes in some areas. They are often deployed via remote control.

**Savant:**  
This morph was developed on Ilmarinen as proof that synthmorphs can also be useful to scientists and engineers. This strangely elegant morph lacks the disturbing mimicry of humanity found in synth and steel morphs. Instead, the ovoid head with its elegantly minimalist face looks more like an artistic sculpture than a metal version of a real human head.

**Steel Morph (Liquid Silver Variant)**  
Designed as a top-end version of the steel morph, this shell’s entire outer covering is composed of active nanomachines. A number of synthmorph performers use this shell’s shape- and color-altering capacities as part of their acts. However, the fact that this morph can disguise itself as any other humanoid synthmorph, including the ubiquitous case morph, means that a number of covert operatives and criminals also make  
use of this morph. This version of the steel morph cannot use a synthetic mask.

**Sundiver:**  
The sundiver is a synthetic morph designed for solar research and emergency rescue operations. Sundivers are sleek mechanisms, about six meters long. They look a little like ramjets, except for a pair of articulated arms that extend forward from the morph’s pointed nose, allowing it to reach for and grasp objects. Because sundivers operate in the coronal environment, they are built to survive superheated plasma and shielded against radiation. Sundivers are equipped with a powerful electromagnetic propulsion system that allows them to skate along solar magnetic lines of force much like the surya do.

**Synthtaur:**  
The synthtaur resembles an elegant mechanical centaur, but is a versatile and extremely durable synthmorph. The shape adjusting enhancement allows it to switch between being a two-armed quadruped standing 1.7 meters tall or a four-armed biped standing 2.4 meters high, as well as allowing it to ﬁt into small spaces. Its telescoping legs even allow it to reduce its height to become a 2-meter-tall bipedal humanoid. This morph is popular with gatecrashers, people exploring ruined habitats, and anyone going into dangerous and remote situations.

**Takko:**  
The first synthetic octopus design from the engineers at Feral Robot is a hardy shell custom-designed to make octopi uplifts feel more at home in a synthetic body with eight functioning appendages. Though it lacks ink sacs, the takko features vectored-thrust jets for microgravity propulsion.

**_Extras:_** `+stigmatized`

**Xu fu:**  
Named after a historical Chinese explorer, many gatecrashers consider xu fus the ideal exoplanet exploration synthmorph. Its main body sits atop 6 legs (up to 2 meters long, though retractable) that end in multidirectional smart wheels for quick travel, capable of rolling in any direction and over rough terrain. For exceptionally difficult terrain, the wheels can be retracted and the xu fu can maneuver as a walker. In addition to two standard arms, it features a third 2-meter long sensor-equipped limb for reaching far distances, overseeing obstacles, etc. Xu fus have an impressive sensor package and are ideal for surface-based scouting as well as investigating tunnels, collecting samples, and so on.
