# Infomorphs and Eidolons

An infomorph is a software emulation of your ego’s neural architecture, running virtually on a computer system, in the mesh, in another person’s ghostrider module, or elsewhere. An infomorph running in a simulated world environment is technically called a “simulmorph” but the term is not consistently used.

As a `+virtual` entity, infomorphs do not have a **_damage track_**, instead, virtual attacks on an Ego’s integrity are resolved using the **_trauma move_**

Infomorphs interact with each other on a software level and, with the right talents or software (**_[Cyberbrain Hacking](https://eclipse-phase-apocalypse.obsidianportal.com/wikis/moves#Cyberbrain)_**), can try to hack each other without requiring the victim to have the `+puppet sock` tag. Furthermore, they have a chance to figure out any software enhancements or upgrades that might be running on another `+virtual` person with an **_Assess the Situation_** roll.

A base informorph has the following characteristics:

**Infomorph:**  
Infomorphs are digital-only forms—they lack a physical body. Infomorphs can live in the mesh or are sometimes carried by other characters instead of (or in addition to) a muse or in a ghostrider module.  
**_Armor:_** None  
**_Tags:_** `+virtual`

An infomorph can be “sleeved” in an eidolon, a software shell environment optimized for certain functions. Eidolons work much the same as physical cyberbrains, and the two are not compatible. This means eidolons are only available for infomorphs and cannot be incorporated into a synthmorph. Any character choosing to begin play as an infomorph may choose one of the following eidolons:

**Agent:**  
An eidolon optimized for infiltration into software systems.  
**_Tags:_** `+eidetic memory`, `+hacking alert`, `+mental speed (intuition)`, `+mnemonic augmentation`

**Digimorph:**  
A basic eidolon with built-in data storage  
**_Tags:_** `+mnemonic augmentation`

**Elite:**  
An eidolon optimized for social interaction.  
**_Tags:_** `+mental speed (savvy)`, `+mnemonic augmentation`

**Hotshot:**  
An eidolon optimized for piloting.  
**_Tags:_** `+increased speed`, `+mnemonic augmentation`

**Sage:**  
An eidolon optimized for mental computation, the infomorph equivalent of a menton.  
**_Tags:_** `+eidetic memory`, `+hyper linguist`, `+math boost`, `+mnemonic augmentation`

**Scholar:**  
A basic eidolon for optimized memory, a cheaper version of the Sage.  
**_Tags:_** `+eidetic memory`, `+mnemonic augmentation`

**Slave:**  
An eidolon rarely used voluntarily.  
**_Tags:_** `+copylock`, `+mnemonic augmentation`, `+modified behavior`

**Wirehead:**  
An eidolon optimized to monitoring information feeds  
**_Tags:_** `+increased speed`, `+mental speed (intuition)`, `+mnemonic augmentation`, `+panopticon`
