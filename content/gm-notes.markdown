# GM Notes

This section has notes relevant to the GM/MC (these terms are used interchangeably throughout). Nothing here is secret or hidden from players.

## The Principles

- Barf forth apocalyptica.
- Address yourself to the characters, not the players.
- Make your move, but misdirect.
- Make your move, but never speak its name.
- Look through crosshairs.
- Name everyone, make everyone human.
- Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.
- Respond with fuckery and intermittent rewards.
- Be a fan of the playersâ€™ characters.
- Think offscreen too.
- Sometimes, disclaim decision-making.
