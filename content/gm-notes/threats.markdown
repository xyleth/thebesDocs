# Threats

There are 7 kinds of threat. When you create a threat, first choose:

- Warlord
- Grotesque
- Affliction
- Brutes
- Landscape
- Terrain
- Vehicle

## Creating a threat

To create a threat:

- Choose its kind, name it, and copy over its impulse. Describe it and list its cast, if any.
- Place it on the threat map. If it’s in motion, mark its direction with an arrow.
- List its stakes questions, if any.
- If it’s connected to other threats, list them.
- If it calls for a custom move or a countdown, create it.

### Warlords

A warlord threat consists of the warlord, plus the gang and other people under the warlord’s control. Choose which kind of warlord:

- Slaver (impulse: to own and sell people)
- Hive queen (impulse: to consume and swarm)
- Prophet (impulse: to denounce and overthrow)
- Dictator (impulse: to control)
- Collector (impulse: to own)
- Alpha wolf (impulse: to hunt and dominate)

Warlords act primarily through their people, acting directly themselves only when cornered or caught out in the open.

### Grotesque

A grotesque is a person—remember fundamentally a person, human, not a monster—whose humanity has been nevertheless somehow crippled.
Choose which kind of grotesque:

- Cannibal (impulse: craves satiety and plenty)
- Mutant (impulse: craves restitution, recompense)
- Pain addict (impulse: craves pain, its own or others’)
- Disease vector (impulse: craves contact, intimate and/or anonymous)
- Mindfucker (impulse: craves mastery)
- Perversion of birth (impulse: craves overthrow, chaos, the ruin of all)

### Afflictions

An affliction threat isn’t a person, it’s something threatening that people
are doing, or that is happening, or that has come to be. Choose which kind
of affliction:

- Disease (impulse: to saturate a population)
- Condition (impulse: to expose people to danger)
- Custom (impulse: to promote and justify violence)
- Delusion (impulse: to dominate people’s choices and actions)
- Sacrifice (impulse: to leave people bereft)
- Barrier (impulse: to impoverish people)

A condition is any bad practical circumstance. e holding’s water filtration breaks down? A bomb-blast weakens the infirmary’s foundation? There’s not enough food to get through the dry season? Conditions.

### Brutes

A brutes threat is a group of people, with or without a leader, acting in crude, perhaps provisional, concert. Choose which kind of brutes:

- Hunting pack (impulse: to victimize anyone vulnerable)
- Sybarites (impulse: to consume someone’s resources)
- Enforcers (impulse: to victimize anyone who stands out)
- Cult (impulse: to victimize & incorporate people)
- Mob (impulse: to riot, burn, kill scapegoats)
- Family (impulse: to close ranks, protect their own)

An individual person within a group of brutes might not share the group’s impulse, and might even fight against it. It’s the group’s impulse, not necessarily any person’s.

### Landscapes

A landscape threat can be natural or constructed, and whatever size you need. The burn flats, the ruins of Las Uncles, a poison’d canal, the holding’s bustling marketplace, the warrens of a grotesque’s den in its depths.

Choose which kind of landscape:

- Prison (impulse: to contain, to deny egress)
- Breeding pit (impulse: to generate badness)
- Furnace (impulse: to consume things)
- Mirage (impulse: to entice and betray people)
- Maze (impulse: to trap, to frustrate passage)
- Fortress (impulse: to deny access)

### Terrain

A terrain threat is a small and immediate piece of a landscape. It’s where the character is right now, what she’s moving through or standing in or trying to get around. Choose which kind of terrain:

- A precipice (impulse: to send someone over)
- A wall (impulse: to bring someone up short)
- An overhang (impulse: to bring danger down upon someone)
- An exposed place (impulse: to expose someone to danger)
- Shifting ground (impulse: to cost someone their bearing)
- Broken ground (impulse: to break what crosses)

Bring terrain threats into play during road wars and moving battles, during exploration and investigations, and whenever the place itself matters.

### Vehicles

Any vehicle distinctive enough to describe individually is a vehicle threat. Hooch the chopper’s aggressive, roaring guzzler of a bike; Audrey the driver’s huge, armored, ram-bearing tow truck; Rolfball the warlord’s garish, jacked up, bulletproof limo. Choose which kind of vehicle:

- Relentless (impulse: to keep moving)
- Cagey (impulse: to protect what it carries)
- Wild (impulse: to defy danger)
- Ferocious (impulse: to outrun)
- Vicious (impulse: to kill and destroy)
- Bold (impulse: to dominate the road)
  _Choose: bastard, bitch, devil, fucker, beast_

It may seem strange to treat vehicles as though they had autonomy like this. Just remember that when someone’s behind the wheel and they roll a miss, or their move gives you a choice between different options, that’s a moment when they’re out of control of their vehicle and it can, in its way, do what it wants
