### **Damage/Sanity Tags:**

- `+disassociated` – You are `+glitched` on all **_trauma move_** rolls.
- `Dead` – Not a tag, so much, as a state of being. If you don’t have a `+cortical stack`, you’re gone.
- `+eccentric` – Gain the [Eccentric](/content/moves/personal#Eccentric) move
- `Insane` – Not a tag, so much, as a state of being. You are unrecoverably insane. Retire your character.
- `+odd` – You’re a bit off, no game mechanical detriment
- `+scuffed` – Minor damage, no game mechanical detriment
- `+stunned` – You are `+glitched` on all actions
- `+wounded` – You are `+degraded` on all actions
