## Range tags

See [A note on ranges](/content/rules/combat.html#a-note-on-ranges) for details. The range tags are:

- `+intimate`
- `+hand`
- `+close`
- `+close/far`
- `+far`

## Weapon Tags:

- `+ap` – Armor Piercing. Usually comes with a rating indicating how many points of **_armor_** the attack ignores (NPCs) or the penalty to your **_damage move_** (PCs).
- `+area` – A weapon with this tag can hit multiple targets in an area, and ignores gang scaling.
- `+autofire` – A weapon with this tag can make a single attack with the `+area` tag, but then gains the `+reload` tag.
- `+bio` – This weapon can only hurt biological targets
- `+bug` – This ammunition contains a tracking bug that monitors the condition and broadcasts the location of whatever its lodged in.
- `+burn` – A weapon with this tag sets things on fire.
- `+capsule` – This ammunition contains a payload of some drug (drugs procured separately)
- `+hi-tech` – This weapon is fiddly, or requires rare materials, or is in other ways less reliable
- `+jammer` – Ammunition disrupts wireless capability in any target it’s embedded in.
- `+messy` – This weapon may hit additional targets, friend or foe.
- `+recoil` – A weapon with this tag packs a punch, and must be set up in advance to use effectively.
- `+refill` – This weapon can only be fired once in your typical battle scene.
- `+reload` – A weapon with this tag needs to be reloaded after firing.
- `+seeker` – This weapon uses seeker ammunition which can track down a target and does not need to be precisely aimed.
- `+shock` – This weapon uses plastic ammunition, or perhaps has incapacitating electricity. Cannot inflict `+stunned`, `+wounded`, or `Dead`, although boxes are marked on the damage track anyway. Targets go unconscious when they would otherwise be `Dead`
- `+synth` – This weapon can only hurt synthetic targets.
