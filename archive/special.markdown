**Special Moves:**

- **_[Cerulean Receiver](https://eclipse-phase-apocalypse.obsidianportal.com/wikis/moves#Cerulean)_**
- **_[Vittrad Infection](https://eclipse-phase-apocalypse.obsidianportal.com/wikis/moves#Vittrad)_**
- **_[Watts-MacLeod Infection](https://eclipse-phase-apocalypse.obsidianportal.com/wikis/moves#Watts)_**

**_Cerulean Receiver_**  
You gain the `+cerulean` tag. Mark one off the Sanity Track that may never be fixed or cured. If you have **_Watts-MacLeod Infection_** or **_Vittrad Infection_** you lose those moves, and any moves dependent on them. At the GM’s discretion, you may replace lost `+psi` moves with `+cerulean` moves. When you **_open yourself to the whispers from outside of time_** tell the GM what you’re concentrating on and roll+Willpower. On a 10+, the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the past or the future of whatever it is. On a 7-9, the GM will tell you something merely interesting. On a failure, your mind becomes untethered from time for a bit… the GM will tell you what happens.

**_Vittrad Infection_**  
You have been infected with the Vittrad strain of the exsurgent virus, and therefore have the `+vittrad` tag. Mark one off the **_sanity track_** which can never be cured or removed. You know at a glance any medical or genetic defects in any biomorph, and are filled with an automatic revulsion and an almost pathological need to cut out the flaws in others.You are `+glitched` in any social dealings with biomorphs, and if given an opportunity to mutilate one you must roll+Willpower to resist the urge.

Vittrad infection does come with some benefits. You also perceive with preternatural speed and precision any material flaws in inorganic structures and synthmorphs, which do not cause the same sense of revulsion. All your attacks, with any weapon, or even bare-handed, gain `+ap-1` as you exploit the weak points in armor, synthmorphs, or structures.

**Watts-MacLeod Infection**  
You have been infected with the Watts-MacLeod strain of the exsurgent virus. Gain `+psi` and mark one off the **_sanity track_** which can never be cured or removed. When you **_assess the situation_**, you may roll+Willpower instead of+Intuition.
